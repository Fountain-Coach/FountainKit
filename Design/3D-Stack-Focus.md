**Why We Drew a Hard Line on 3D**

FountainAI’s 3D story taught a blunt lesson: diffusion of stacks drains momentum. We experimented with Metal/SDL, bespoke runtimes, and web mirrors in parallel; each path multiplied build breakage, spec drift, and test fragility. Three.js + cannon.js is not “the shiniest” — it is the most constrained, portable, and observable option for our publishing surfaces. By collapsing to one stack, we trade theoretical fidelity for actual velocity: one physics model to reason about, one rendering path to debug, and one set of browser-native tooling to keep CI, robots, and prompts aligned. The hard rule is a focus rule: fewer engines mean fewer invariants to keep in sync, fewer OpenAPI surfaces to curate, and far less institutional memory wasted on glue code. The purge proved the cost of bloat; the payoff is a simpler runway for instruments that matter.
