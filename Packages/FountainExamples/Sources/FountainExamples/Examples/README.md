# HelloFountainAITeatro


This example queries a running Semantic Browser service and renders the response status using Teatro.

> **Note:** When building on macOS, the example requires macOS 14 or later because `TeatroRenderAPI` targets that version.

## Linux

Build and run:

```bash
swift run hello-fountainai-teatro > output.svg
```

The SVG is written to `stdout`, redirect it to a file to save.
