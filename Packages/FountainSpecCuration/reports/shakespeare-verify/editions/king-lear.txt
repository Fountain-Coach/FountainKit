King Lear
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. King Lear's palace. ****
     Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND
KENT
     I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
     Albany than Cornwall.
GLOUCESTER
     It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
     division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
     the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
     weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
     of either's moiety.
KENT
     Is not this your son, my lord?
GLOUCESTER
     His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
     so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
     brazed to it.
KENT
     I cannot conceive you.
GLOUCESTER
     Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
     she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
     for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
     Do you smell a fault?
KENT
     I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
     being so proper.
GLOUCESTER
     But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
     elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
     though this knave came something saucily into the
     world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
     fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
     whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
     noble gentleman, Edmund?
EDMUND
     No, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
     honourable friend.
EDMUND
     My services to your lordship.
KENT
     I must love you, and sue to know you better.
EDMUND
     Sir, I shall study deserving.
GLOUCESTER
     He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
     again. The king is coming.
     Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA,
     and Attendants
KING LEAR
     Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
GLOUCESTER
     I shall, my liege.
     Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
KING LEAR
     Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
     Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
     In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
     To shake all cares and business from our age;
     Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
     We have this hour a constant will to publish
     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
     May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
     And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
     Since now we will divest us both of rule,
     Interest of territory, cares of state,--
     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
     That we our largest bounty may extend
     Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
     Our eldest-born, speak first.
GONERIL
     Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
     Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
     Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
     As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
CORDELIA
     [Aside] What shall Cordelia do?
     Love, and be silent.
LEAR
     Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
     With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
     With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
     We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
     Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
REGAN
     Sir, I am made
     Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
     I find she names my very deed of love;
     Only she comes too short: that I profess
     Myself an enemy to all other joys,
     Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
     And find I am alone felicitate
     In your dear highness' love.
CORDELIA
     [Aside] Then poor Cordelia!
     And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
     More richer than my tongue.
KING LEAR
     To thee and thine hereditary ever
     Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
     No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
     Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
     Although the last, not least; to whose young love
     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
     Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
CORDELIA
     Nothing, my lord.
KING LEAR
     Nothing!
CORDELIA
     Nothing.
KING LEAR
     Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
CORDELIA
     Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
     My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
     According to my bond; nor more nor less.
KING LEAR
     How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
     Lest it may mar your fortunes.
CORDELIA
     Good my lord,
     You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
     Return those duties back as are right fit,
     Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
     Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
     They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
     That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
     Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
     Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
     To love my father all.
KING LEAR
     But goes thy heart with this?
CORDELIA
     Ay, good my lord.
KING LEAR
     So young, and so untender?
CORDELIA
     So young, my lord, and true.
KING LEAR
     Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
     The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
     By all the operation of the orbs
     From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
     Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
     Propinquity and property of blood,
     And as a stranger to my heart and me
     Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
     Or he that makes his generation messes
     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
     As thou my sometime daughter.
KENT
     Good my liege,--
KING LEAR
     Peace, Kent!
     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
     I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
     On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
     So be my grave my peace, as here I give
     Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
     Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
     With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
     Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
     I do invest you jointly with my power,
     Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
     With reservation of an hundred knights,
     By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
     The name, and all the additions to a king;
     The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
     Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
     This coronet part betwixt you.
     Giving the crown
KENT
     Royal Lear,
     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
     Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
     As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
KING LEAR
     The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
KENT
     Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
     The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
     When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
     When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
     And, in thy best consideration, cheque
     This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
     Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
     Reverbs no hollowness.
KING LEAR
     Kent, on thy life, no more.
KENT
     My life I never held but as a pawn
     To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
     Thy safety being the motive.
KING LEAR
     Out of my sight!
KENT
     See better, Lear; and let me still remain
     The true blank of thine eye.
KING LEAR
     Now, by Apollo,--
KENT
     Now, by Apollo, king,
     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
KING LEAR
     O, vassal! miscreant!
     Laying his hand on his sword
ALBANY CORNWALL
     Dear sir, forbear.
KENT
     Do:
     Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
     Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
     Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
     I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
KING LEAR
     Hear me, recreant!
     On thine allegiance, hear me!
     Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
     Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
     To come between our sentence and our power,
     Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
     Our potency made good, take thy reward.
     Five days we do allot thee, for provision
     To shield thee from diseases of the world;
     And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
     Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
     Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
     The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
     This shall not be revoked.
KENT
     Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
     Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
     To CORDELIA
     The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
     That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
     To REGAN and GONERIL
     And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
     That good effects may spring from words of love.
     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
     He'll shape his old course in a country new.
     Exit
     Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and
     Attendants
GLOUCESTER
     Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
KING LEAR
     My lord of Burgundy.
     We first address towards you, who with this king
     Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
     Will you require in present dower with her,
     Or cease your quest of love?
BURGUNDY
     Most royal majesty,
     I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
     Nor will you tender less.
KING LEAR
     Right noble Burgundy,
     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
     But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
     If aught within that little seeming substance,
     Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
     And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
     She's there, and she is yours.
BURGUNDY
     I know no answer.
KING LEAR
     Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
     Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
     Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
     Take her, or leave her?
BURGUNDY
     Pardon me, royal sir;
     Election makes not up on such conditions.
KING LEAR
     Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
     I tell you all her wealth.
     To KING OF FRANCE
     For you, great king,
     I would not from your love make such a stray,
     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
     To avert your liking a more worthier way
     Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
     Almost to acknowledge hers.
KING OF FRANCE
     This is most strange,
     That she, that even but now was your best object,
     The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
     Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
     Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
     So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
     Must be of such unnatural degree,
     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
     Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
     Must be a faith that reason without miracle
     Could never plant in me.
CORDELIA
     I yet beseech your majesty,--
     If for I want that glib and oily art,
     To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
     I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
     It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
     No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
     That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
     But even for want of that for which I am richer,
     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
     As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
     Hath lost me in your liking.
KING LEAR
     Better thou
     Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
KING OF FRANCE
     Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
     Which often leaves the history unspoke
     That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
     What say you to the lady? Love's not love
     When it is mingled with regards that stand
     Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
     She is herself a dowry.
BURGUNDY
     Royal Lear,
     Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
     Duchess of Burgundy.
KING LEAR
     Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
BURGUNDY
     I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
     That you must lose a husband.
CORDELIA
     Peace be with Burgundy!
     Since that respects of fortune are his love,
     I shall not be his wife.
KING OF FRANCE
     Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
     Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
     Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
     Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
     My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
     Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
     Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
     Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
     Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
     Thou losest here, a better where to find.
KING LEAR
     Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
     Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
     That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
     Without our grace, our love, our benison.
     Come, noble Burgundy.
     Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA
KING OF FRANCE
     Bid farewell to your sisters.
CORDELIA
     The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
     Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
     And like a sister am most loath to call
     Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
     To your professed bosoms I commit him
     But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
     I would prefer him to a better place.
     So, farewell to you both.
REGAN
     Prescribe not us our duties.
GONERIL
     Let your study
     Be to content your lord, who hath received you
     At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
     And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
CORDELIA
     Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
     Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
     Well may you prosper!
KING OF FRANCE
     Come, my fair Cordelia.
     Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA
GONERIL
     Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
     most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
     father will hence to-night.
REGAN
     That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
GONERIL
     You see how full of changes his age is; the
     observation we have made of it hath not been
     little: he always loved our sister most; and
     with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
     appears too grossly.
REGAN
     'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
     but slenderly known himself.
GONERIL
     The best and soundest of his time hath been but
     rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
     not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
     condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
     that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
REGAN
     Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
     him as this of Kent's banishment.
GONERIL
     There is further compliment of leavetaking
     between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
     together: if our father carry authority with
     such dispositions as he bears, this last
     surrender of his will but offend us.
REGAN
     We shall further think on't.
GONERIL
     We must do something, and i' the heat.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle. ****
     Enter EDMUND, with a letter
EDMUND
     Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
     My services are bound. Wherefore should I
     Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
     The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
     For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
     Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
     When my dimensions are as well compact,
     My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
     As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
     With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
     Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
     More composition and fierce quality
     Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
     Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
     Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
     Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
     Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
     As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
     Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
     And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
     Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
     Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
     Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
     And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
     Confined to exhibition! All this done
     Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
EDMUND
     So please your lordship, none.
     Putting up the letter
GLOUCESTER
     Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
EDMUND
     I know no news, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     What paper were you reading?
EDMUND
     Nothing, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
     it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
     not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
     if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
EDMUND
     I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
     from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
     and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
     fit for your o'er-looking.
GLOUCESTER
     Give me the letter, sir.
EDMUND
     I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
     contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
GLOUCESTER
     Let's see, let's see.
EDMUND
     I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
     this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
GLOUCESTER
     [Reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes
     the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
     our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
     them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
     in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
     as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
     me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
     would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
     revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
     brother, EDGAR.'
     Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
     should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
     Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
     to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
     brought it?
EDMUND
     It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
     cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
     casement of my closet.
GLOUCESTER
     You know the character to be your brother's?
EDMUND
     If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
     it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
     fain think it were not.
GLOUCESTER
     It is his.
EDMUND
     It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
     not in the contents.
GLOUCESTER
     Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
EDMUND
     Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
     maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
     and fathers declining, the father should be as
     ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
GLOUCESTER
     O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
     letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
     brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
     seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
     Where is he?
EDMUND
     I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
     you to suspend your indignation against my
     brother till you can derive from him better
     testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
     course; where, if you violently proceed against
     him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
     gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
     heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
     for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
     affection to your honour, and to no further
     pretence of danger.
GLOUCESTER
     Think you so?
EDMUND
     If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
     where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
     auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
     that without any further delay than this very evening.
GLOUCESTER
     He cannot be such a monster--
EDMUND
     Nor is not, sure.
GLOUCESTER
     To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
     loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
     out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
     business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
     myself, to be in a due resolution.
EDMUND
     I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
     business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.
GLOUCESTER
     These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
     no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
     reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
     scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
     friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
     cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
     palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
     and father. This villain of mine comes under the
     prediction; there's son against father: the king
     falls from bias of nature; there's father against
     child. We have seen the best of our time:
     machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
     ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
     graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
     lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
     noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
     offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.
     Exit
EDMUND
     This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
     when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
     of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
     disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
     if we were villains by necessity; fools by
     heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
     treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
     liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
     by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
     of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
     disposition to the charge of a star! My
     father compounded with my mother under the
     dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
     major; so that it follows, I am rough and
     lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
     had the maidenliest star in the firmament
     twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
     Enter EDGAR
     And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
     comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
     sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
     portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.
EDGAR
     How now, brother Edmund! what serious
     contemplation are you in?
EDMUND
     I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
     this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
EDGAR
     Do you busy yourself about that?
EDMUND
     I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
     unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
     and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
     ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
     maledictions against king and nobles; needless
     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
     of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
EDGAR
     How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
EDMUND
     Come, come; when saw you my father last?
EDGAR
     Why, the night gone by.
EDMUND
     Spake you with him?
EDGAR
     Ay, two hours together.
EDMUND
     Parted you in good terms? Found you no
     displeasure in him by word or countenance?
EDGAR
     None at all.
EDMUND
     Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
     him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
     till some little time hath qualified the heat of
     his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
     in him, that with the mischief of your person it
     would scarcely allay.
EDGAR
     Some villain hath done me wrong.
EDMUND
     That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
     forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
     slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
     lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
     hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
     if you do stir abroad, go armed.
EDGAR
     Armed, brother!
EDMUND
     Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
     am no honest man if there be any good meaning
     towards you: I have told you what I have seen
     and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
     and horror of it: pray you, away.
EDGAR
     Shall I hear from you anon?
EDMUND
     I do serve you in this business.
     Exit EDGAR
     A credulous father! and a brother noble,
     Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
     That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
     My practises ride easy! I see the business.
     Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
     All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

**** SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace. ****
     Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward
GONERIL
     Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
OSWALD
     Yes, madam.
GONERIL
     By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
     He flashes into one gross crime or other,
     That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
     His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
     On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
     I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
     If you come slack of former services,
     You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
OSWALD
     He's coming, madam; I hear him.
     Horns within
GONERIL
     Put on what weary negligence you please,
     You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
     If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
     Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
     Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
     That still would manage those authorities
     That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
     Old fools are babes again; and must be used
     With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
     Remember what I tell you.
OSWALD
     Well, madam.
GONERIL
     And let his knights have colder looks among you;
     What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
     I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
     That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
     To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A hall in the same. ****
     Enter KENT, disguised
KENT
     If but as well I other accents borrow,
     That can my speech defuse, my good intent
     May carry through itself to that full issue
     For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
     If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
     So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
     Shall find thee full of labours.
     Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants
KING LEAR
     Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
     Exit an Attendant
     How now! what art thou?
KENT
     A man, sir.
KING LEAR
     What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?
KENT
     I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
     him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
     that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
     and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
     cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
KING LEAR
     What art thou?
KENT
     A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
KING LEAR
     If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
     king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
KENT
     Service.
KING LEAR
     Who wouldst thou serve?
KENT
     You.
KING LEAR
     Dost thou know me, fellow?
KENT
     No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
     which I would fain call master.
KING LEAR
     What's that?
KENT
     Authority.
KING LEAR
     What services canst thou do?
KENT
     I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
     tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
     bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
     qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.
KING LEAR
     How old art thou?
KENT
     Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
     so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
     on my back forty eight.
KING LEAR
     Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
     worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
     Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
     Go you, and call my fool hither.
     Exit an Attendant
     Enter OSWALD
     You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
OSWALD
     So please you,--
     Exit
KING LEAR
     What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
     Exit a Knight
     Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.
     Re-enter Knight
     How now! where's that mongrel?
Knight
     He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
KING LEAR
     Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
Knight
     Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
     not.
KING LEAR
     He would not!
Knight
     My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
     judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
     ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
     great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
     general dependants as in the duke himself also and
     your daughter.
KING LEAR
     Ha! sayest thou so?
Knight
     I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
     for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
     highness wronged.
KING LEAR
     Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
     have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
     have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
     than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
     I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
     have not seen him this two days.
Knight
     Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
     fool hath much pined away.
KING LEAR
     No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
     tell my daughter I would speak with her.
     Exit an Attendant
     Go you, call hither my fool.
     Exit an Attendant
     Re-enter OSWALD
     O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
     sir?
OSWALD
     My lady's father.
KING LEAR
     'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
     whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
OSWALD
     I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
KING LEAR
     Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
     Striking him
OSWALD
     I'll not be struck, my lord.
KENT
     Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
     Tripping up his heels
KING LEAR
     I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
     love thee.
KENT
     Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
     away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
     length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
     wisdom? so.
     Pushes OSWALD out
KING LEAR
     Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
     earnest of thy service.
     Giving KENT money
     Enter Fool
Fool
     Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.
     Offering KENT his cap
KING LEAR
     How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?
Fool
     Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
KENT
     Why, fool?
Fool
     Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
     nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
     thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
     why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
     and did the third a blessing against his will; if
     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
     How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
KING LEAR
     Why, my boy?
Fool
     If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
     myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.
KING LEAR
     Take heed, sirrah; the whip.
Fool
     Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
     out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.
KING LEAR
     A pestilent gall to me!
Fool
     Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
KING LEAR
     Do.
Fool
     Mark it, nuncle:
     Have more than thou showest,
     Speak less than thou knowest,
     Lend less than thou owest,
     Ride more than thou goest,
     Learn more than thou trowest,
     Set less than thou throwest;
     Leave thy drink and thy whore,
     And keep in-a-door,
     And thou shalt have more
     Than two tens to a score.
KENT
     This is nothing, fool.
Fool
     Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
     gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
     nothing, nuncle?
KING LEAR
     Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.
Fool
     [To KENT] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
     his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.
KING LEAR
     A bitter fool!
Fool
     Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
     bitter fool and a sweet fool?
KING LEAR
     No, lad; teach me.
Fool
     That lord that counsell'd thee
     To give away thy land,
     Come place him here by me,
     Do thou for him stand:
     The sweet and bitter fool
     Will presently appear;
     The one in motley here,
     The other found out there.
KING LEAR
     Dost thou call me fool, boy?
Fool
     All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
     thou wast born with.
KENT
     This is not altogether fool, my lord.
Fool
     No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
     I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
     and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
     to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
     nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.
KING LEAR
     What two crowns shall they be?
Fool
     Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
     up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
     clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
     both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
     the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
     when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
     like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
     finds it so.
     Singing
     Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
     For wise men are grown foppish,
     They know not how their wits to wear,
     Their manners are so apish.
KING LEAR
     When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
Fool
     I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
     daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
     the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,
     Singing
     Then they for sudden joy did weep,
     And I for sorrow sung,
     That such a king should play bo-peep,
     And go the fools among.
     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
     thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
KING LEAR
     An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
Fool
     I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
     they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
     have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
     whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
     kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
     thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
     and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
     the parings.
     Enter GONERIL
KING LEAR
     How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
     Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.
Fool
     Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
     care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
     figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
     thou art nothing.
     To GONERIL
     Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
     bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
     He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
     Weary of all, shall want some.
     Pointing to KING LEAR
     That's a shealed peascod.
GONERIL
     Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
     But other of your insolent retinue
     Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
     In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
     I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
     To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
     By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
     That you protect this course, and put it on
     By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
     Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
     Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
     Might in their working do you that offence,
     Which else were shame, that then necessity
     Will call discreet proceeding.
Fool
     For, you trow, nuncle,
     The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
     That it's had it head bit off by it young.
     So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
KING LEAR
     Are you our daughter?
GONERIL
     Come, sir,
     I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
     Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
     These dispositions, that of late transform you
     From what you rightly are.
Fool
     May not an ass know when the cart
     draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
KING LEAR
     Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
     Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
     Either his notion weakens, his discernings
     Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
     Who is it that can tell me who I am?
Fool
     Lear's shadow.
KING LEAR
     I would learn that; for, by the
     marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
     I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
Fool
     Which they will make an obedient father.
KING LEAR
     Your name, fair gentlewoman?
GONERIL
     This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
     To understand my purposes aright:
     As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
     That this our court, infected with their manners,
     Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
     Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
     For instant remedy: be then desired
     By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
     A little to disquantity your train;
     And the remainder, that shall still depend,
     To be such men as may besort your age,
     And know themselves and you.
KING LEAR
     Darkness and devils!
     Saddle my horses; call my train together:
     Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
     Yet have I left a daughter.
GONERIL
     You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
     Make servants of their betters.
     Enter ALBANY
KING LEAR
     Woe, that too late repents,--
     To ALBANY
     O, sir, are you come?
     Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
     More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
     Than the sea-monster!
ALBANY
     Pray, sir, be patient.
KING LEAR
     [To GONERIL] Detested kite! thou liest.
     My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
     That all particulars of duty know,
     And in the most exact regard support
     The worships of their name. O most small fault,
     How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
     That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
     From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
     And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
     Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
     Striking his head
     And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
ALBANY
     My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
     Of what hath moved you.
KING LEAR
     It may be so, my lord.
     Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
     Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
     To make this creature fruitful!
     Into her womb convey sterility!
     Dry up in her the organs of increase;
     And from her derogate body never spring
     A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
     Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
     And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
     Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
     With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
     Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
     To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
     To have a thankless child! Away, away!
     Exit
ALBANY
     Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
GONERIL
     Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
     But let his disposition have that scope
     That dotage gives it.
     Re-enter KING LEAR
KING LEAR
     What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
     Within a fortnight!
ALBANY
     What's the matter, sir?
KING LEAR
     I'll tell thee:
     To GONERIL
     Life and death! I am ashamed
     That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
     That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
     Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
     The untented woundings of a father's curse
     Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
     Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
     And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
     To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
     Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
     Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
     When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
     She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
     That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
     I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
     I warrant thee.
     Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants
GONERIL
     Do you mark that, my lord?
ALBANY
     I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
     To the great love I bear you,--
GONERIL
     Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
     To the Fool
     You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.
Fool
     Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
     with thee.
     A fox, when one has caught her,
     And such a daughter,
     Should sure to the slaughter,
     If my cap would buy a halter:
     So the fool follows after.
     Exit
GONERIL
     This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
     'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
     At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
     Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
     He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
     And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!
ALBANY
     Well, you may fear too far.
GONERIL
     Safer than trust too far:
     Let me still take away the harms I fear,
     Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
     What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
     If she sustain him and his hundred knights
     When I have show'd the unfitness,--
     Re-enter OSWALD
     How now, Oswald!
     What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
OSWALD
     Yes, madam.
GONERIL
     Take you some company, and away to horse:
     Inform her full of my particular fear;
     And thereto add such reasons of your own
     As may compact it more. Get you gone;
     And hasten your return.
     Exit OSWALD
     No, no, my lord,
     This milky gentleness and course of yours
     Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
     You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
     Than praised for harmful mildness.
ALBANY
     How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
GONERIL
     Nay, then--
ALBANY
     Well, well; the event.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Court before the same. ****
     Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
KING LEAR
     Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
     Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
     know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
     If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.
KENT
     I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
     your letter.
     Exit
Fool
     If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
     danger of kibes?
KING LEAR
     Ay, boy.
Fool
     Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
     slip-shod.
KING LEAR
     Ha, ha, ha!
Fool
     Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
     for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
     apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
KING LEAR
     Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
Fool
     She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
     crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
     the middle on's face?
KING LEAR
     No.
Fool
     Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
     what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
KING LEAR
     I did her wrong--
Fool
     Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
KING LEAR
     No.
Fool
     Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
KING LEAR
     Why?
Fool
     Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
     daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
KING LEAR
     I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
     horses ready?
Fool
     Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
     seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
KING LEAR
     Because they are not eight?
Fool
     Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
KING LEAR
     To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
Fool
     If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
     for being old before thy time.
KING LEAR
     How's that?
Fool
     Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
     been wise.
KING LEAR
     O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
     Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
     Enter Gentleman
     How now! are the horses ready?
Gentleman
     Ready, my lord.
KING LEAR
     Come, boy.
Fool
     She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
     Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle. ****
     Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him
EDMUND
     Save thee, Curan.
CURAN
     And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
     given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
     his duchess will be here with him this night.
EDMUND
     How comes that?
CURAN
     Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
     I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
     ear-kissing arguments?
EDMUND
     Not I pray you, what are they?
CURAN
     Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
     Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
EDMUND
     Not a word.
CURAN
     You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
     Exit
EDMUND
     The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
     This weaves itself perforce into my business.
     My father hath set guard to take my brother;
     And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
     Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
     Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
     Enter EDGAR
     My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
     Intelligence is given where you are hid;
     You have now the good advantage of the night:
     Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
     He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
     And Regan with him: have you nothing said
     Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
     Advise yourself.
EDGAR
     I am sure on't, not a word.
EDMUND
     I hear my father coming: pardon me:
     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
     Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
     Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
     Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
     Exit EDGAR
     Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
     Wounds his arm
     Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
     Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
     Stop, stop! No help?
     Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches
GLOUCESTER
     Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
EDMUND
     Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
     Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
     To stand auspicious mistress,--
GLOUCESTER
     But where is he?
EDMUND
     Look, sir, I bleed.
GLOUCESTER
     Where is the villain, Edmund?
EDMUND
     Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--
GLOUCESTER
     Pursue him, ho! Go after.
     Exeunt some Servants
     By no means what?
EDMUND
     Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
     But that I told him, the revenging gods
     'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
     Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
     The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
     Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
     To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
     With his prepared sword, he charges home
     My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
     But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
     Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
     Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
     Full suddenly he fled.
GLOUCESTER
     Let him fly far:
     Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
     And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
     My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
     By his authority I will proclaim it,
     That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
     Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
     He that conceals him, death.
EDMUND
     When I dissuaded him from his intent,
     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
     I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
     'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
     If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
     Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
     Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
     As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
     My very character,--I'ld turn it all
     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
     And thou must make a dullard of the world,
     If they not thought the profits of my death
     Were very pregnant and potential spurs
     To make thee seek it.'
GLOUCESTER
     Strong and fasten'd villain
     Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
     Tucket within
     Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
     All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
     The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
     I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
     May have the due note of him; and of my land,
     Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
     To make thee capable.
     Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants
CORNWALL
     How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
     Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
REGAN
     If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
     Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?
GLOUCESTER
     O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
REGAN
     What, did my father's godson seek your life?
     He whom my father named? your Edgar?
GLOUCESTER
     O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
REGAN
     Was he not companion with the riotous knights
     That tend upon my father?
GLOUCESTER
     I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
EDMUND
     Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
REGAN
     No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
     To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
     I have this present evening from my sister
     Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
     That if they come to sojourn at my house,
     I'll not be there.
CORNWALL
     Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
     Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
     A child-like office.
EDMUND
     'Twas my duty, sir.
GLOUCESTER
     He did bewray his practise; and received
     This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
CORNWALL
     Is he pursued?
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, my good lord.
CORNWALL
     If he be taken, he shall never more
     Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
     How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
     So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
     You we first seize on.
EDMUND
     I shall serve you, sir,
     Truly, however else.
GLOUCESTER
     For him I thank your grace.
CORNWALL
     You know not why we came to visit you,--
REGAN
     Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
     Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
     Wherein we must have use of your advice:
     Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
     Of differences, which I least thought it fit
     To answer from our home; the several messengers
     From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
     Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
     Your needful counsel to our business,
     Which craves the instant use.
GLOUCESTER
     I serve you, madam:
     Your graces are right welcome.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle. ****
     Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally
OSWALD
     Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
KENT
     Ay.
OSWALD
     Where may we set our horses?
KENT
     I' the mire.
OSWALD
     Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
KENT
     I love thee not.
OSWALD
     Why, then, I care not for thee.
KENT
     If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
     care for me.
OSWALD
     Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
KENT
     Fellow, I know thee.
OSWALD
     What dost thou know me for?
KENT
     A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
     base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
     hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
     lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
     glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
     one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
     bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
     the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
     and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
     will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
     the least syllable of thy addition.
OSWALD
     Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
     on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
KENT
     What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
     knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
     thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
     rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
     shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
     draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
     Drawing his sword
OSWALD
     Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
KENT
     Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
     king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
     royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
     carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.
OSWALD
     Help, ho! murder! help!
KENT
     Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
     slave, strike.
     Beating him
OSWALD
     Help, ho! murder! murder!
     Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and
     Servants
EDMUND
     How now! What's the matter?
KENT
     With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
     flesh ye; come on, young master.
GLOUCESTER
     Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?
CORNWALL
     Keep peace, upon your lives:
     He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
REGAN
     The messengers from our sister and the king.
CORNWALL
     What is your difference? speak.
OSWALD
     I am scarce in breath, my lord.
KENT
     No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
     cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
     tailor made thee.
CORNWALL
     Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
KENT
     Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
     not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
     hours at the trade.
CORNWALL
     Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
OSWALD
     This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
     at suit of his gray beard,--
KENT
     Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
     lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
     unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
     a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
CORNWALL
     Peace, sirrah!
     You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
KENT
     Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
CORNWALL
     Why art thou angry?
KENT
     That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
     Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
     Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
     Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
     That in the natures of their lords rebel;
     Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
     Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
     With every gale and vary of their masters,
     Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
     A plague upon your epileptic visage!
     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
     Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
CORNWALL
     Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
GLOUCESTER
     How fell you out? say that.
KENT
     No contraries hold more antipathy
     Than I and such a knave.
CORNWALL
     Why dost thou call him a knave? What's his offence?
KENT
     His countenance likes me not.
CORNWALL
     No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
KENT
     Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
     I have seen better faces in my time
     Than stands on any shoulder that I see
     Before me at this instant.
CORNWALL
     This is some fellow,
     Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
     A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
     Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
     An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
     An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
     These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
     Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
     Than twenty silly ducking observants
     That stretch their duties nicely.
KENT
     Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
     Under the allowance of your great aspect,
     Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
     On flickering Phoebus' front,--
CORNWALL
     What mean'st by this?
KENT
     To go out of my dialect, which you
     discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
     flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
     accent was a plain knave; which for my part
     I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
     to entreat me to 't.
CORNWALL
     What was the offence you gave him?
OSWALD
     I never gave him any:
     It pleased the king his master very late
     To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
     When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
     Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
     And put upon him such a deal of man,
     That worthied him, got praises of the king
     For him attempting who was self-subdued;
     And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
     Drew on me here again.
KENT
     None of these rogues and cowards
     But Ajax is their fool.
CORNWALL
     Fetch forth the stocks!
     You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
     We'll teach you--
KENT
     Sir, I am too old to learn:
     Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
     On whose employment I was sent to you:
     You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
     Against the grace and person of my master,
     Stocking his messenger.
CORNWALL
     Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
     There shall he sit till noon.
REGAN
     Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
KENT
     Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
     You should not use me so.
REGAN
     Sir, being his knave, I will.
CORNWALL
     This is a fellow of the self-same colour
     Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
     Stocks brought out
GLOUCESTER
     Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
     His fault is much, and the good king his master
     Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
     Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
     For pilferings and most common trespasses
     Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
     That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
     Should have him thus restrain'd.
CORNWALL
     I'll answer that.
REGAN
     My sister may receive it much more worse,
     To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
     KENT is put in the stocks
     Come, my good lord, away.
     Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT
GLOUCESTER
     I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
     Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
     Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.
KENT
     Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
     Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
     A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
     Give you good morrow!
GLOUCESTER
     The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
     Exit
KENT
     Good king, that must approve the common saw,
     Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
     To the warm sun!
     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
     That by thy comfortable beams I may
     Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
     But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
     Of my obscured course; and shall find time
     From this enormous state, seeking to give
     Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
     This shameful lodging.
     Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!
     Sleeps
**** SCENE III. A wood. ****
     Enter EDGAR
EDGAR
     I heard myself proclaim'd;
     And by the happy hollow of a tree
     Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
     That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
     Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
     I will preserve myself: and am bethought
     To take the basest and most poorest shape
     That ever penury, in contempt of man,
     Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
     Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
     And with presented nakedness out-face
     The winds and persecutions of the sky.
     The country gives me proof and precedent
     Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
     Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
     Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
     And with this horrible object, from low farms,
     Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
     Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
     Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
     That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
     Exit
**** SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks. ****
     Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman
KING LEAR
     'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
     And not send back my messenger.
Gentleman
     As I learn'd,
     The night before there was no purpose in them
     Of this remove.
KENT
     Hail to thee, noble master!
KING LEAR
     Ha!
     Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
KENT
     No, my lord.
Fool
     Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
     by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
     the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
     over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
     nether-stocks.
KING LEAR
     What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
     To set thee here?
KENT
     It is both he and she;
     Your son and daughter.
KING LEAR
     No.
KENT
     Yes.
KING LEAR
     No, I say.
KENT
     I say, yea.
KING LEAR
     No, no, they would not.
KENT
     Yes, they have.
KING LEAR
     By Jupiter, I swear, no.
KENT
     By Juno, I swear, ay.
KING LEAR
     They durst not do 't;
     They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
     To do upon respect such violent outrage:
     Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
     Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
     Coming from us.
KENT
     My lord, when at their home
     I did commend your highness' letters to them,
     Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
     My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
     Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
     From Goneril his mistress salutations;
     Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
     Which presently they read: on whose contents,
     They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
     Commanded me to follow, and attend
     The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
     And meeting here the other messenger,
     Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
     Being the very fellow that of late
     Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
     Having more man than wit about me, drew:
     He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
     The shame which here it suffers.
Fool
     Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
     Fathers that wear rags
     Do make their children blind;
     But fathers that bear bags
     Shall see their children kind.
     Fortune, that arrant whore,
     Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
     But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
     for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
KING LEAR
     O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
     Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
     Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
KENT
     With the earl, sir, here within.
KING LEAR
     Follow me not;
     Stay here.
     Exit
Gentleman
     Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
KENT
     None.
     How chance the king comes with so small a train?
Fool
     And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
     question, thou hadst well deserved it.
KENT
     Why, fool?
Fool
     We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
     there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
     their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
     there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
     that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
     runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
     following it: but the great one that goes up the
     hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
     gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
     would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
     That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
     And follows but for form,
     Will pack when it begins to rain,
     And leave thee in the storm,
     But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
     And let the wise man fly:
     The knave turns fool that runs away;
     The fool no knave, perdy.
KENT
     Where learned you this, fool?
Fool
     Not i' the stocks, fool.
     Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER

     Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
     They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
     The images of revolt and flying off.
     Fetch me a better answer.
GLOUCESTER
     My dear lord,
     You know the fiery quality of the duke;
     How unremoveable and fix'd he is
     In his own course.
KING LEAR
     Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
     Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
GLOUCESTER
     Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
KING LEAR
     Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, my good lord.
KING LEAR
     The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
     Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
     Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
     No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
     Infirmity doth still neglect all office
     Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
     When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
     To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
     And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
     To take the indisposed and sickly fit
     For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
     Looking on KENT
     Should he sit here? This act persuades me
     That this remotion of the duke and her
     Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
     Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
     Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
     Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
     Till it cry sleep to death.
GLOUCESTER
     I would have all well betwixt you.
     Exit
KING LEAR
     O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!
Fool
     Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
     when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
     o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
     wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
     kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
     Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants
KING LEAR
     Good morrow to you both.
CORNWALL
     Hail to your grace!
     KENT is set at liberty
REGAN
     I am glad to see your highness.
KING LEAR
     Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
     I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
     Sepulchring an adultress.
     To KENT
     O, are you free?
     Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
     Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
     Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
     Points to his heart
     I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
     With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
REGAN
     I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
     You less know how to value her desert
     Than she to scant her duty.
KING LEAR
     Say, how is that?
REGAN
     I cannot think my sister in the least
     Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
     As clears her from all blame.
KING LEAR
     My curses on her!
REGAN
     O, sir, you are old.
     Nature in you stands on the very verge
     Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
     By some discretion, that discerns your state
     Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
     That to our sister you do make return;
     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
KING LEAR
     Ask her forgiveness?
     Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
     'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
     Kneeling
     Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
REGAN
     Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
     Return you to my sister.
KING LEAR
     [Rising] Never, Regan:
     She hath abated me of half my train;
     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
     All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
     On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
     You taking airs, with lameness!
CORNWALL
     Fie, sir, fie!
KING LEAR
     You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
     To fall and blast her pride!
REGAN
     O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
     When the rash mood is on.
KING LEAR
     No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
     Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
     Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
     And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
     Against my coming in: thou better know'st
     The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
     Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
     Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
     Wherein I thee endow'd.
REGAN
     Good sir, to the purpose.
KING LEAR
     Who put my man i' the stocks?
     Tucket within
CORNWALL
     What trumpet's that?
REGAN
     I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
     That she would soon be here.
     Enter OSWALD
     Is your lady come?
KING LEAR
     This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
     Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
     Out, varlet, from my sight!
CORNWALL
     What means your grace?
KING LEAR
     Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
     Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
     Enter GONERIL
     If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
     Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
     Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
     To GONERIL
     Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
GONERIL
     Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
     All's not offence that indiscretion finds
     And dotage terms so.
KING LEAR
     O sides, you are too tough;
     Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?
CORNWALL
     I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
     Deserved much less advancement.
KING LEAR
     You! did you?
REGAN
     I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
     If, till the expiration of your month,
     You will return and sojourn with my sister,
     Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
     I am now from home, and out of that provision
     Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
KING LEAR
     Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
     To wage against the enmity o' the air;
     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
     To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
     Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
     To this detested groom.
     Pointing at OSWALD
GONERIL
     At your choice, sir.
KING LEAR
     I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
     We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
     But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
     Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
     Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
     A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
     I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
     Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
     Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
     I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
     I and my hundred knights.
REGAN
     Not altogether so:
     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
     For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
     For those that mingle reason with your passion
     Must be content to think you old, and so--
     But she knows what she does.
KING LEAR
     Is this well spoken?
REGAN
     I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
     Is it not well? What should you need of more?
     Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
     Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
     Should many people, under two commands,
     Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
GONERIL
     Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
     From those that she calls servants or from mine?
REGAN
     Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
     We could control them. If you will come to me,--
     For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
     To bring but five and twenty: to no more
     Will I give place or notice.
KING LEAR
     I gave you all--
REGAN
     And in good time you gave it.
KING LEAR
     Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
     But kept a reservation to be follow'd
     With such a number. What, must I come to you
     With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?
REGAN
     And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.
KING LEAR
     Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
     When others are more wicked: not being the worst
     Stands in some rank of praise.
     To GONERIL
     I'll go with thee:
     Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
     And thou art twice her love.
GONERIL
     Hear me, my lord;
     What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
     To follow in a house where twice so many
     Have a command to tend you?
REGAN
     What need one?
KING LEAR
     O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
     Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
     Allow not nature more than nature needs,
     Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
     If only to go warm were gorgeous,
     Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
     Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
     You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
     As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
     If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
     Against their father, fool me not so much
     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
     And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
     I will have such revenges on you both,
     That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
     What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
     The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
     No, I'll not weep:
     I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
     Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
     Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
     Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool
     Storm and tempest
CORNWALL
     Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
REGAN
     This house is little: the old man and his people
     Cannot be well bestow'd.
GONERIL
     'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
     And must needs taste his folly.
REGAN
     For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
     But not one follower.
GONERIL
     So am I purposed.
     Where is my lord of Gloucester?
CORNWALL
     Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
     Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     The king is in high rage.
CORNWALL
     Whither is he going?
GLOUCESTER
     He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
CORNWALL
     'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
GONERIL
     My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
GLOUCESTER
     Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
     Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout
     There's scarce a bush.
REGAN
     O, sir, to wilful men,
     The injuries that they themselves procure
     Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
     He is attended with a desperate train;
     And what they may incense him to, being apt
     To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.
CORNWALL
     Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
     My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. A heath. ****
     Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting
KENT
     Who's there, besides foul weather?
Gentleman
     One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
KENT
     I know you. Where's the king?
Gentleman
     Contending with the fretful element:
     Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
     Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
     Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
     Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
     Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
     The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
     The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
     Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
     And bids what will take all.
KENT
     But who is with him?
Gentleman
     None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
     His heart-struck injuries.
KENT
     Sir, I do know you;
     And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
     Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
     Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
     With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
     Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
     Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
     Which are to France the spies and speculations
     Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
     Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
     Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
     Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
     Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
     But, true it is, from France there comes a power
     Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
     Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
     In some of our best ports, and are at point
     To show their open banner. Now to you:
     If on my credit you dare build so far
     To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
     Some that will thank you, making just report
     Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
     The king hath cause to plain.
     I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
     And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
     This office to you.
Gentleman
     I will talk further with you.
KENT
     No, do not.
     For confirmation that I am much more
     Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
     What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
     As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
     And she will tell you who your fellow is
     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
     I will go seek the king.
Gentleman
     Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
KENT
     Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
     That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
     That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
     Holla the other.
     Exeunt severally
**** SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still. ****
     Enter KING LEAR and Fool
KING LEAR
     Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
     You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
     Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
     Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
     That make ingrateful man!
Fool
     O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
     house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
     Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:
     here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
KING LEAR
     Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
     Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
     I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
     You owe me no subscription: then let fall
     Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
     A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
     But yet I call you servile ministers,
     That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
     Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
     So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!
Fool
     He that has a house to put's head in has a good
     head-piece.
     The cod-piece that will house
     Before the head has any,
     The head and he shall louse;
     So beggars marry many.
     The man that makes his toe
     What he his heart should make
     Shall of a corn cry woe,
     And turn his sleep to wake.
     For there was never yet fair woman but she made
     mouths in a glass.
KING LEAR
     No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
     I will say nothing.
     Enter KENT
KENT
     Who's there?
Fool
     Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise
     man and a fool.
KENT
     Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
     Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
     And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
     Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
     Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
     Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
     The affliction nor the fear.
KING LEAR
     Let the great gods,
     That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
     That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
     Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
     Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
     That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
     That under covert and convenient seeming
     Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
     Rive your concealing continents, and cry
     These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
     More sinn'd against than sinning.
KENT
     Alack, bare-headed!
     Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
     Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
     Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
     More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
     Which even but now, demanding after you,
     Denied me to come in--return, and force
     Their scanted courtesy.
KING LEAR
     My wits begin to turn.
     Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
     I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
     The art of our necessities is strange,
     That can make vile things precious. Come,
     your hovel.
     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
     That's sorry yet for thee.
Fool
     [Singing]
     He that has and a little tiny wit--
     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
     Must make content with his fortunes fit,
     For the rain it raineth every day.
KING LEAR
     True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
     Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT
Fool
     This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
     I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
     When priests are more in word than matter;
     When brewers mar their malt with water;
     When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
     No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
     When every case in law is right;
     No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
     When slanders do not live in tongues;
     Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
     When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
     And bawds and whores do churches build;
     Then shall the realm of Albion
     Come to great confusion:
     Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
     That going shall be used with feet.
     This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. Gloucester's castle. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
GLOUCESTER
     Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
     dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
     pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
     house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
     displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
     him, nor any way sustain him.
EDMUND
     Most savage and unnatural!
GLOUCESTER
     Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
     the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
     received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
     spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
     these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
     home; there's part of a power already footed: we
     must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
     privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
     the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
     if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
     Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
     the king my old master must be relieved. There is
     some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.
     Exit
EDMUND
     This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
     Instantly know; and of that letter too:
     This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
     That which my father loses; no less than all:
     The younger rises when the old doth fall.
     Exit
**** SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel. ****
     Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
KENT
     Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
     The tyranny of the open night's too rough
     For nature to endure.
     Storm still
KING LEAR
     Let me alone.
KENT
     Good my lord, enter here.
KING LEAR
     Wilt break my heart?
KENT
     I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
KING LEAR
     Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
     Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
     But where the greater malady is fix'd,
     The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
     Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
     mind's free,
     The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
     Doth from my senses take all feeling else
     Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
     No, I will weep no more. In such a night
     To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
     No more of that.
KENT
     Good my lord, enter here.
KING LEAR
     Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
     On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
     To the Fool
     In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
     Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
     Fool goes in
     Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
     And show the heavens more just.
EDGAR
     [Within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
     The Fool runs out from the hovel
Fool
     Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
     Help me, help me!
KENT
     Give me thy hand. Who's there?
Fool
     A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.
KENT
     What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
     Come forth.
     Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man
EDGAR
     Away! the foul fiend follows me!
     Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
     Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
KING LEAR
     Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
     And art thou come to this?
EDGAR
     Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
     fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
     through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
     that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
     in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
     proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
     four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
     traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
     de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
     star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
     charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
     have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
     Storm still
KING LEAR
     What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
     Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?
Fool
     Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
KING LEAR
     Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
KENT
     He hath no daughters, sir.
KING LEAR
     Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
     Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
     Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
     Those pelican daughters.
EDGAR
     Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
     Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!
Fool
     This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
EDGAR
     Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
     keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
     man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
     array. Tom's a-cold.
KING LEAR
     What hast thou been?
EDGAR
     A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
     my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
     my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
     her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
     broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
     slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
     wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
     out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
     ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
     wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
     Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
     silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
     out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
     from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
     Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
     Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
     Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
     Storm still
KING LEAR
     Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
     with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
     Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
     owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
     no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
     's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
     forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
     come unbutton here.
     Tearing off his clothes
Fool
     Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
     to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
     like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
     rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.
     Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch
EDGAR
     This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
     at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
     the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
     hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
     poor creature of earth.
     S. Withold footed thrice the old;
     He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
     Bid her alight,
     And her troth plight,
     And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
KENT
     How fares your grace?
KING LEAR
     What's he?
KENT
     Who's there? What is't you seek?
GLOUCESTER
     What are you there? Your names?
EDGAR
     Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
     the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
     the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
     eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
     the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
     standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
     tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
     hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
     body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
     But mice and rats, and such small deer,
     Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
     Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!
GLOUCESTER
     What, hath your grace no better company?
EDGAR
     The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
     Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
GLOUCESTER
     Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
     That it doth hate what gets it.
EDGAR
     Poor Tom's a-cold.
GLOUCESTER
     Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
     To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
     Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
     And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
     Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
     And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
KING LEAR
     First let me talk with this philosopher.
     What is the cause of thunder?
KENT
     Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.
KING LEAR
     I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
     What is your study?
EDGAR
     How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
KING LEAR
     Let me ask you one word in private.
KENT
     Importune him once more to go, my lord;
     His wits begin to unsettle.
GLOUCESTER
     Canst thou blame him?
     Storm still
     His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
     He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
     Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
     I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
     Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
     But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
     No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
     The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
     I do beseech your grace,--
KING LEAR
     O, cry your mercy, sir.
     Noble philosopher, your company.
EDGAR
     Tom's a-cold.
GLOUCESTER
     In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.
KING LEAR
     Come let's in all.
KENT
     This way, my lord.
KING LEAR
     With him;
     I will keep still with my philosopher.
KENT
     Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
GLOUCESTER
     Take him you on.
KENT
     Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
KING LEAR
     Come, good Athenian.
GLOUCESTER
     No words, no words: hush.
EDGAR
     Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
     His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
     I smell the blood of a British man.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Gloucester's castle. ****
     Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND
CORNWALL
     I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
EDMUND
     How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
     gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
     of.
CORNWALL
     I now perceive, it was not altogether your
     brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
     but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
     badness in himself.
EDMUND
     How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
     be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
     approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
     of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
     or not I the detector!
CORNWALL
     o with me to the duchess.
EDMUND
     If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
     mighty business in hand.
CORNWALL
     True or false, it hath made thee earl of
     Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
     may be ready for our apprehension.
EDMUND
     [Aside] If I find him comforting the king, it will
     stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
     my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
     between that and my blood.
CORNWALL
     I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
     dearer father in my love.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR
GLOUCESTER
     Here is better than the open air; take it
     thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
     addition I can: I will not be long from you.
KENT
     All the power of his wits have given way to his
     impatience: the gods reward your kindness!
     Exit GLOUCESTER
EDGAR
     Frateretto calls me; and tells me
     Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
     Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
Fool
     Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
     gentleman or a yeoman?
KING LEAR
     A king, a king!
Fool
     No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
     for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
     before him.
KING LEAR
     To have a thousand with red burning spits
     Come hissing in upon 'em,--
EDGAR
     The foul fiend bites my back.
Fool
     He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
     horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
KING LEAR
     It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
     To EDGAR
     Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
     To the Fool
     Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!
EDGAR
     Look, where he stands and glares!
     Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
     Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--
Fool
     Her boat hath a leak,
     And she must not speak
     Why she dares not come over to thee.
EDGAR
     The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
     nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
     white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
     food for thee.
KENT
     How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
     Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
KING LEAR
     I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
     To EDGAR
     Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
     To the Fool
     And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
     Bench by his side:
     To KENT
     you are o' the commission,
     Sit you too.
EDGAR
     Let us deal justly.
     Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
     Thy sheep be in the corn;
     And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
     Thy sheep shall take no harm.
     Pur! the cat is gray.
KING LEAR
     Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
     oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
     poor king her father.
Fool
     Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
KING LEAR
     She cannot deny it.
Fool
     Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
KING LEAR
     And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
     What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
     Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
     False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?
EDGAR
     Bless thy five wits!
KENT
     O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
     That thou so oft have boasted to retain?
EDGAR
     [Aside] My tears begin to take his part so much,
     They'll mar my counterfeiting.
KING LEAR
     The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
     Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.
EDGAR
     Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
     Be thy mouth or black or white,
     Tooth that poisons if it bite;
     Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
     Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
     Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
     Tom will make them weep and wail:
     For, with throwing thus my head,
     Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
     Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
     fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
KING LEAR
     Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
     about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
     makes these hard hearts?
     To EDGAR
     You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
     do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
     say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.
KENT
     Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
KING LEAR
     Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
     so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.
Fool
     And I'll go to bed at noon.
     Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?
KENT
     Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.
GLOUCESTER
     Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
     I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
     There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
     And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
     Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
     If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
     With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
     Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
     And follow me, that will to some provision
     Give thee quick conduct.
KENT
     Oppressed nature sleeps:
     This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
     Which, if convenience will not allow,
     Stand in hard cure.
     To the Fool
     Come, help to bear thy master;
     Thou must not stay behind.
GLOUCESTER
     Come, come, away.
     Exeunt all but EDGAR
EDGAR
     When we our betters see bearing our woes,
     We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
     Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
     Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
     But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
     When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
     How light and portable my pain seems now,
     When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
     He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
     Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
     When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
     In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
     What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
     Lurk, lurk.
     Exit
**** SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle. ****
     Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants
CORNWALL
     Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
     this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
     out the villain Gloucester.
     Exeunt some of the Servants
REGAN
     Hang him instantly.
GONERIL
     Pluck out his eyes.
CORNWALL
     Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
     sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
     upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
     beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
     a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
     like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
     betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
     lord of Gloucester.
     Enter OSWALD
     How now! where's the king?
OSWALD
     My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
     Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
     Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
     Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
     Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
     To have well-armed friends.
CORNWALL
     Get horses for your mistress.
GONERIL
     Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
CORNWALL
     Edmund, farewell.
     Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
     Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
     Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
     Exeunt other Servants
     Though well we may not pass upon his life
     Without the form of justice, yet our power
     Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
     May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
     Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three
REGAN
     Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
CORNWALL
     Bind fast his corky arms.
GLOUCESTER
     What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
     You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.
CORNWALL
     Bind him, I say.
     Servants bind him
REGAN
     Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
GLOUCESTER
     Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.
CORNWALL
     To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
     REGAN plucks his beard
GLOUCESTER
     By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
     To pluck me by the beard.
REGAN
     So white, and such a traitor!
GLOUCESTER
     Naughty lady,
     These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
     Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
     With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
     You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
CORNWALL
     Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
REGAN
     Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
CORNWALL
     And what confederacy have you with the traitors
     Late footed in the kingdom?
REGAN
     To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
GLOUCESTER
     I have a letter guessingly set down,
     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
     And not from one opposed.
CORNWALL
     Cunning.
REGAN
     And false.
CORNWALL
     Where hast thou sent the king?
GLOUCESTER
     To Dover.
REGAN
     Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
CORNWALL
     Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
GLOUCESTER
     I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.
REGAN
     Wherefore to Dover, sir?
GLOUCESTER
     Because I would not see thy cruel nails
     Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
     In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
     The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
     In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
     And quench'd the stelled fires:
     Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
     If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
     Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
     All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
     The winged vengeance overtake such children.
CORNWALL
     See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
     Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
GLOUCESTER
     He that will think to live till he be old,
     Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!
REGAN
     One side will mock another; the other too.
CORNWALL
     If you see vengeance,--
First Servant
     Hold your hand, my lord:
     I have served you ever since I was a child;
     But better service have I never done you
     Than now to bid you hold.
REGAN
     How now, you dog!
First Servant
     If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
     I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
CORNWALL
     My villain!
     They draw and fight
First Servant
     Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
REGAN
     Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
     Takes a sword, and runs at him behind
First Servant
     O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
     To see some mischief on him. O!
     Dies
CORNWALL
     Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
     Where is thy lustre now?
GLOUCESTER
     All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
     Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
     To quit this horrid act.
REGAN
     Out, treacherous villain!
     Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
     That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
     Who is too good to pity thee.
GLOUCESTER
     O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
     Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
REGAN
     Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
     His way to Dover.
     Exit one with GLOUCESTER
     How is't, my lord? how look you?
CORNWALL
     I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
     Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
     Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
     Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
     Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN
Second Servant
     I'll never care what wickedness I do,
     If this man come to good.
Third Servant
     If she live long,
     And in the end meet the old course of death,
     Women will all turn monsters.
Second Servant
     Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
     To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
     Allows itself to any thing.
Third Servant
     Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
     To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!

EDGAR
     Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
     Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
     The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
     Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
     The lamentable change is from the best;
     The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
     Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
     The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst

Old Man
     O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
     your father's tenant, these fourscore years.
GLOUCESTER
     Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:

     I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
     I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
     Our means secure us, and our mere defects
     Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
     The food of thy abused father's wrath!
     Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
     I'ld say I had eyes again!
Old Man
     How now! Who's there?
EDGAR
     [Aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
     the worst'?
     I am worse than e'er I was.
Old Man
     'Tis poor mad Tom.
EDGAR
     [Aside] And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
     So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
Old Man
     Fellow, where goest?
GLOUCESTER
     Is it a beggar-man?
Old Man
     Madman and beggar too.
GLOUCESTER
     He has some reason, else he could not beg.
     I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
     Which made me think a man a worm: my son
     Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
     Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
     more since.
     As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
     They kill us for their sport.
EDGAR
     [Aside] How should this be?
     Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
     Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!
GLOUCESTER
     Is that the naked fellow?
Old Man
     Ay, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
     Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
     I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
     And bring some covering for this naked soul,
     Who I'll entreat to lead me.
Old Man
     Alack, sir, he is mad.
GLOUCESTER
     'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
     Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
     Above the rest, be gone.
Old Man
     I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
     Come on't what will.
     Exit
GLOUCESTER
     Sirrah, naked fellow,--
EDGAR
     Poor Tom's a-cold.
     Aside
     I cannot daub it further.
GLOUCESTER
     Come hither, fellow.
EDGAR
     [Aside] And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
GLOUCESTER
     Know'st thou the way to Dover?
EDGAR
     Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
     Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
     thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
     fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
     Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
     stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
     mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
     and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!
GLOUCESTER
     Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
     Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
     Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
     Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
     Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
     So distribution should undo excess,
     And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
EDGAR
     Ay, master.
GLOUCESTER
     There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
     Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
     Bring me but to the very brim of it,
     And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
     With something rich about me: from that place
     I shall no leading need.
EDGAR
     Give me thy arm:
     Poor Tom shall lead thee.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace. ****
     Enter GONERIL and EDMUND
GONERIL
     Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
     Not met us on the way.
     Enter OSWALD
     Now, where's your master'?
OSWALD
     Madam, within; but never man so changed.
     I told him of the army that was landed;
     He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
     His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
     And of the loyal service of his son,
     When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
     And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
     What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
     What like, offensive.
GONERIL
     [To EDMUND] Then shall you go no further.
     It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
     That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
     Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
     May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
     Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
     I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
     Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
     Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
     If you dare venture in your own behalf,
     A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
     Giving a favour
     Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
     Conceive, and fare thee well.
EDMUND
     Yours in the ranks of death.
GONERIL
     My most dear Gloucester!
     Exit EDMUND
     O, the difference of man and man!
     To thee a woman's services are due:
     My fool usurps my body.
OSWALD
     Madam, here comes my lord.
     Exit
     Enter ALBANY
GONERIL
     I have been worth the whistle.
ALBANY
     O Goneril!
     You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
     Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
     That nature, which contemns its origin,
     Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
     She that herself will sliver and disbranch
     From her material sap, perforce must wither
     And come to deadly use.
GONERIL
     No more; the text is foolish.
ALBANY
     Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
     Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
     Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
     A father, and a gracious aged man,
     Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
     Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
     Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
     A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
     If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
     Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
     It will come,
     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
     Like monsters of the deep.
GONERIL
     Milk-liver'd man!
     That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
     Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
     Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
     Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
     Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
     France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
     With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
     Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
     'Alack, why does he so?'
ALBANY
     See thyself, devil!
     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
     So horrid as in woman.
GONERIL
     O vain fool!
ALBANY
     Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
     Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
     To let these hands obey my blood,
     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
     Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
     A woman's shape doth shield thee.
GONERIL
     Marry, your manhood now--
     Enter a Messenger
ALBANY
     What news?
Messenger
     O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
     Slain by his servant, going to put out
     The other eye of Gloucester.
ALBANY
     Gloucester's eye!
Messenger
     A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
     Opposed against the act, bending his sword
     To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
     Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
     But not without that harmful stroke, which since
     Hath pluck'd him after.
ALBANY
     This shows you are above,
     You justicers, that these our nether crimes
     So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
     Lost he his other eye?
Messenger
     Both, both, my lord.
     This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
     'Tis from your sister.
GONERIL
     [Aside] One way I like this well;
     But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
     May all the building in my fancy pluck
     Upon my hateful life: another way,
     The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
     Exit
ALBANY
     Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Messenger
     Come with my lady hither.
ALBANY
     He is not here.
Messenger
     No, my good lord; I met him back again.
ALBANY
     Knows he the wickedness?
Messenger
     Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
     And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
     Might have the freer course.
ALBANY
     Gloucester, I live
     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
     And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
     Tell me what more thou know'st.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The French camp near Dover. ****
     Enter KENT and a Gentleman
KENT
     Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
     know you the reason?
Gentleman
     Something he left imperfect in the
     state, which since his coming forth is thought
     of; which imports to the kingdom so much
     fear and danger, that his personal return was
     most required and necessary.
KENT
     Who hath he left behind him general?
Gentleman
     The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
KENT
     Did your letters pierce the queen to any
     demonstration of grief?
Gentleman
     Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
     And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
     Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
     Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
     Sought to be king o'er her.
KENT
     O, then it moved her.
Gentleman
     Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
     Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
     Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
     That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
     What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
     As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
     Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
     If all could so become it.
KENT
     Made she no verbal question?
Gentleman
     'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
     Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
     Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
     Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
     Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
     The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
     And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
     To deal with grief alone.
KENT
     It is the stars,
     The stars above us, govern our conditions;
     Else one self mate and mate could not beget
     Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
Gentleman
     No.
KENT
     Was this before the king return'd?
Gentleman
     No, since.
KENT
     Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
     Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
     What we are come about, and by no means
     Will yield to see his daughter.
Gentleman
     Why, good sir?
KENT
     A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
     That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
     To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
     To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
     His mind so venomously, that burning shame
     Detains him from Cordelia.
Gentleman
     Alack, poor gentleman!
KENT
     Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
Gentleman
     'Tis so, they are afoot.
KENT
     Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
     And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
     Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
     Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
     Along with me.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. The same. A tent. ****
     Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers
CORDELIA
     Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
     As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
     Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
     With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
     Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
     In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
     Search every acre in the high-grown field,
     And bring him to our eye.
     Exit an Officer
     What can man's wisdom
     In the restoring his bereaved sense?
     He that helps him take all my outward worth.
Doctor
     There is means, madam:
     Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
     The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
     Are many simples operative, whose power
     Will close the eye of anguish.
CORDELIA
     All blest secrets,
     All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
     Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
     In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
     Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
     That wants the means to lead it.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     News, madam;
     The British powers are marching hitherward.
CORDELIA
     'Tis known before; our preparation stands
     In expectation of them. O dear father,
     It is thy business that I go about;
     Therefore great France
     My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
     No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
     But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
     Soon may I hear and see him!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Gloucester's castle. ****
     Enter REGAN and OSWALD
REGAN
     But are my brother's powers set forth?
OSWALD
     Ay, madam.
REGAN
     Himself in person there?
OSWALD
     Madam, with much ado:
     Your sister is the better soldier.
REGAN
     Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
OSWALD
     No, madam.
REGAN
     What might import my sister's letter to him?
OSWALD
     I know not, lady.
REGAN
     'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
     To let him live: where he arrives he moves
     All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
     In pity of his misery, to dispatch
     His nighted life: moreover, to descry
     The strength o' the enemy.
OSWALD
     I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
REGAN
     Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
     The ways are dangerous.
OSWALD
     I may not, madam:
     My lady charged my duty in this business.
REGAN
     Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
     Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
     Let me unseal the letter.
OSWALD
     Madam, I had rather--
REGAN
     I know your lady does not love her husband;
     I am sure of that: and at her late being here
     She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
     To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
OSWALD
     I, madam?
REGAN
     I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
     Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
     My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
     And more convenient is he for my hand
     Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
     If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
     I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
     So, fare you well.
     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
OSWALD
     Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
     What party I do follow.
REGAN
     Fare thee well.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. Fields near Dover. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant
GLOUCESTER
     When shall we come to the top of that same hill?
EDGAR
     You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.
GLOUCESTER
     Methinks the ground is even.
EDGAR
     Horrible steep.
     Hark, do you hear the sea?
GLOUCESTER
     No, truly.
EDGAR
     Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
     By your eyes' anguish.
GLOUCESTER
     So may it be, indeed:
     Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
EDGAR
     You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
     But in my garments.
GLOUCESTER
     Methinks you're better spoken.
EDGAR
     Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
     And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
     The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
     Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
     Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
     The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
     Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
     That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
     Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
     Topple down headlong.
GLOUCESTER
     Set me where you stand.
EDGAR
     Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
     Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
     Would I not leap upright.
GLOUCESTER
     Let go my hand.
     Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
     Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
     Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
     Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
EDGAR
     Now fare you well, good sir.
GLOUCESTER
     With all my heart.
EDGAR
     Why I do trifle thus with his despair
     Is done to cure it.
GLOUCESTER
     [Kneeling] O you mighty gods!
     This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
     Shake patiently my great affliction off:
     If I could bear it longer, and not fall
     To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
     My snuff and loathed part of nature should
     Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
     Now, fellow, fare thee well.
     He falls forward
EDGAR
     Gone, sir: farewell.
     And yet I know not how conceit may rob
     The treasury of life, when life itself
     Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
     By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
     Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
     Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
     What are you, sir?
GLOUCESTER
     Away, and let me die.
EDGAR
     Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
     So many fathom down precipitating,
     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
     Ten masts at each make not the altitude
     Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
     Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
GLOUCESTER
     But have I fall'n, or no?
EDGAR
     From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
     Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
     Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
GLOUCESTER
     Alack, I have no eyes.
     Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
     And frustrate his proud will.
EDGAR
     Give me your arm:
     Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
GLOUCESTER
     Too well, too well.
EDGAR
     This is above all strangeness.
     Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
     Which parted from you?
GLOUCESTER
     A poor unfortunate beggar.
EDGAR
     As I stood here below, methought his eyes
     Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
     Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
     It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
     Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.
GLOUCESTER
     I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
     Affliction till it do cry out itself
     'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
     I took it for a man; often 'twould say
     'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.
EDGAR
     Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
     Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
     His master thus.
KING LEAR
     No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
     king himself.
EDGAR
     O thou side-piercing sight!
KING LEAR
     Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
     press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
     crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
     look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
     cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
     it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
     flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
     Give the word.
EDGAR
     Sweet marjoram.
KING LEAR
     Pass.
GLOUCESTER
     I know that voice.
KING LEAR
     Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
     me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
     beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
     and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
     too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
     wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
     the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
     found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
     not men o' their words: they told me I was every
     thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
GLOUCESTER
     The trick of that voice I do well remember:
     Is 't not the king?
KING LEAR
     Ay, every inch a king:
     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
     I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
     Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
     The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
     Does lecher in my sight.
     Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
     Was kinder to his father than my daughters
     Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
     To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
     Behold yond simpering dame,
     Whose face between her forks presages snow;
     That minces virtue, and does shake the head
     To hear of pleasure's name;
     The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
     With a more riotous appetite.
     Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
     Though women all above:
     But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
     Beneath is all the fiends';
     There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
     sulphurous pit,
     Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
     fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
     good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
     there's money for thee.
GLOUCESTER
     O, let me kiss that hand!
KING LEAR
     Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
GLOUCESTER
     O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
     Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
KING LEAR
     I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
     at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
     love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
     penning of it.
GLOUCESTER
     Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
EDGAR
     I would not take this from report; it is,
     And my heart breaks at it.
KING LEAR
     Read.
GLOUCESTER
     What, with the case of eyes?
KING LEAR
     O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
     head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
     a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
     this world goes.
GLOUCESTER
     I see it feelingly.
KING LEAR
     What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
     with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
     justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
     thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
     is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
     a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, sir.
KING LEAR
     And the creature run from the cur? There thou
     mightst behold the great image of authority: a
     dog's obeyed in office.
     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
     Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
     Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
     For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
     Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
     None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
     Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
     To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
     And like a scurvy politician, seem
     To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
     Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.
EDGAR
     O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!
KING LEAR
     If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
     I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
     Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
     We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
GLOUCESTER
     Alack, alack the day!
KING LEAR
     When we are born, we cry that we are come
     To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
     It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
     A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
     And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
     Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
     Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants
Gentleman
     O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
     Your most dear daughter--
KING LEAR
     No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
     The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
     You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
     I am cut to the brains.
Gentleman
     You shall have any thing.
KING LEAR
     No seconds? all myself?
     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
     To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
Gentleman
     Good sir,--
KING LEAR
     I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
     I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
     My masters, know you that.
Gentleman
     You are a royal one, and we obey you.
KING LEAR
     Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
     shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
     Exit running; Attendants follow
Gentleman
     A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
     Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
     Who redeems nature from the general curse
     Which twain have brought her to.
EDGAR
     Hail, gentle sir.
Gentleman
     Sir, speed you: what's your will?
EDGAR
     Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
Gentleman
     Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
     Which can distinguish sound.
EDGAR
     But, by your favour,
     How near's the other army?
Gentleman
     Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
     Stands on the hourly thought.
EDGAR
     I thank you, sir: that's all.
Gentleman
     Though that the queen on special cause is here,
     Her army is moved on.
EDGAR
     I thank you, sir.
     Exit Gentleman
GLOUCESTER
     You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
     To die before you please!
EDGAR
     Well pray you, father.
GLOUCESTER
     Now, good sir, what are you?
EDGAR
     A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
     Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
     I'll lead you to some biding.
GLOUCESTER
     Hearty thanks:
     The bounty and the benison of heaven
     To boot, and boot!
     Enter OSWALD
OSWALD
     A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
     That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
     To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
     Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
     That must destroy thee.
GLOUCESTER
     Now let thy friendly hand
     Put strength enough to't.
     EDGAR interposes
OSWALD
     Wherefore, bold peasant,
     Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
     Lest that the infection of his fortune take
     Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
EDGAR
     Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
OSWALD
     Let go, slave, or thou diest!
EDGAR
     Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
     pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
     'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
     Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
     ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
     the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.
OSWALD
     Out, dunghill!
EDGAR
     Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
     your foins.
     They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down
OSWALD
     Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
     If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
     And give the letters which thou find'st about me
     To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
     Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
     Dies
EDGAR
     I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
     As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
     As badness would desire.
GLOUCESTER
     What, is he dead?
EDGAR
     Sit you down, father; rest you
     Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
     May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
     He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
     To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
     Their papers, is more lawful.
     Reads
     'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
     many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
     want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
     There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
     then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
     the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
     the place for your labour.
     'Your--wife, so I would say--
     'Affectionate servant,
     'GONERIL.'
     O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
     A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
     And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
     Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
     Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
     With this ungracious paper strike the sight
     Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
     That of thy death and business I can tell.
GLOUCESTER
     The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
     That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
     Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
     So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
     And woes by wrong imaginations lose
     The knowledge of themselves.
EDGAR
     Give me your hand:
     Drum afar off
     Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
     Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep, ****
     soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.
     Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor
CORDELIA
     O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
     To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
     And every measure fail me.
KENT
     To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
     All my reports go with the modest truth;
     Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
CORDELIA
     Be better suited:
     These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
     I prithee, put them off.
KENT
     Pardon me, dear madam;
     Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
     My boon I make it, that you know me not
     Till time and I think meet.
CORDELIA
     Then be't so, my good lord.
     To the Doctor
     How does the king?
Doctor
     Madam, sleeps still.
CORDELIA
     O you kind gods,
     Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
     The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
     Of this child-changed father!
Doctor
     So please your majesty
     That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
CORDELIA
     Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
     I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
Gentleman
     Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
     We put fresh garments on him.
Doctor
     Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
     I doubt not of his temperance.
CORDELIA
     Very well.
Doctor
     Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!
CORDELIA
     O my dear father! Restoration hang
     Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
     Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
     Have in thy reverence made!
KENT
     Kind and dear princess!
CORDELIA
     Had you not been their father, these white flakes
     Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
     To be opposed against the warring winds?
     To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
     In the most terrible and nimble stroke
     Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
     With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
     Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
     Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
     To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
     In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
     'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
     Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
Doctor
     Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
CORDELIA
     How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
KING LEAR
     You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
     Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
     Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
     Do scald like moulten lead.
CORDELIA
     Sir, do you know me?
KING LEAR
     You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?
CORDELIA
     Still, still, far wide!
Doctor
     He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
KING LEAR
     Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
     I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
     To see another thus. I know not what to say.
     I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
     I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
     Of my condition!
CORDELIA
     O, look upon me, sir,
     And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
     No, sir, you must not kneel.
KING LEAR
     Pray, do not mock me:
     I am a very foolish fond old man,
     Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
     And, to deal plainly,
     I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
     Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
     Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
     What place this is; and all the skill I have
     Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
     Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
     For, as I am a man, I think this lady
     To be my child Cordelia.
CORDELIA
     And so I am, I am.
KING LEAR
     Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
     I know you do not love me; for your sisters
     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
     You have some cause, they have not.
CORDELIA
     No cause, no cause.
KING LEAR
     Am I in France?
KENT
     In your own kingdom, sir.
KING LEAR
     Do not abuse me.
Doctor
     Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
     You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
     Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
     Till further settling.
CORDELIA
     Will't please your highness walk?
KING LEAR
     You must bear with me:
     Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
     Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman
Gentleman
     Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
KENT
     Most certain, sir.
Gentleman
     Who is conductor of his people?
KENT
     As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
Gentleman
     They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
     of Kent in Germany.
KENT
     Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
     powers of the kingdom approach apace.
Gentleman
     The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
     well, sir.
     Exit
KENT
     My point and period will be throughly wrought,
     Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
     Exit
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover. ****
     Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.
EDMUND
     Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
     Or whether since he is advised by aught
     To change the course: he's full of alteration
     And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
     To a Gentleman, who goes out
REGAN
     Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
EDMUND
     'Tis to be doubted, madam.
REGAN
     Now, sweet lord,
     You know the goodness I intend upon you:
     Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
     Do you not love my sister?
EDMUND
     In honour'd love.
REGAN
     But have you never found my brother's way
     To the forfended place?
EDMUND
     That thought abuses you.
REGAN
     I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
EDMUND
     No, by mine honour, madam.
REGAN
     I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
     Be not familiar with her.
EDMUND
     Fear me not:
     She and the duke her husband!
     Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers
GONERIL
     [Aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
     Should loosen him and me.
ALBANY
     Our very loving sister, well be-met.
     Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
     With others whom the rigor of our state
     Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
     I never yet was valiant: for this business,
     It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
     Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
     Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
EDMUND
     Sir, you speak nobly.
REGAN
     Why is this reason'd?
GONERIL
     Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
     For these domestic and particular broils
     Are not the question here.
ALBANY
     Let's then determine
     With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
EDMUND
     I shall attend you presently at your tent.
REGAN
     Sister, you'll go with us?
GONERIL
     No.
REGAN
     'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.
GONERIL
     [Aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
     As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised
EDGAR
     If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
     Hear me one word.
ALBANY
     I'll overtake you. Speak.
     Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR
EDGAR
     Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
     If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
     For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
     I can produce a champion that will prove
     What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
     Your business of the world hath so an end,
     And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
ALBANY
     Stay till I have read the letter.
EDGAR
     I was forbid it.
     When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
     And I'll appear again.
ALBANY
     Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
     Exit EDGAR
     Re-enter EDMUND
EDMUND
     The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
     Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
     By diligent discovery; but your haste
     Is now urged on you.
ALBANY
     We will greet the time.
     Exit
EDMUND
     To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
     Each jealous of the other, as the stung
     Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
     Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
     If both remain alive: to take the widow
     Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
     And hardly shall I carry out my side,
     Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
     His countenance for the battle; which being done,
     Let her who would be rid of him devise
     His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
     Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
     The battle done, and they within our power,
     Shall never see his pardon; for my state
     Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

EDGAR
     Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
     For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
     If ever I return to you again,
     I'll bring you comfort.
GLOUCESTER
     Grace go with you, sir!

EDGAR
     Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
     King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
     Give me thy hand; come on.
GLOUCESTER
     No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.
EDGAR
     What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
     Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
     Ripeness is all: come on.
GLOUCESTER

**** SCENE III. The British camp near Dover. ****
     Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND, KING LEAR and
     CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers, & c
EDMUND
     Some officers take them away: good guard,
     Until their greater pleasures first be known
     That are to censure them.
CORDELIA
     We are not the first
     Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
     For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
     Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
KING LEAR
     No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
     We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
     When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
     And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
     And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
     At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
     Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
     Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
     And take upon's the mystery of things,
     As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
     In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
     That ebb and flow by the moon.
EDMUND
     Take them away.
KING LEAR
     Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
     The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
     He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
     And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
     The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
     Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
     first. Come.
     Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded
EDMUND
     Come hither, captain; hark.
     Take thou this note;
     Giving a paper
     go follow them to prison:
     One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
     To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
     Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
     Does not become a sword: thy great employment
     Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
     Or thrive by other means.
Captain
     I'll do 't, my lord.
EDMUND
     About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
     Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
     As I have set it down.
Captain
     I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
     If it be man's work, I'll do 't.
     Exit
     Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers
ALBANY
     Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
     And fortune led you well: you have the captives
     That were the opposites of this day's strife:
     We do require them of you, so to use them
     As we shall find their merits and our safety
     May equally determine.
EDMUND
     Sir, I thought it fit
     To send the old and miserable king
     To some retention and appointed guard;
     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
     To pluck the common bosom on his side,
     An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
     Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
     My reason all the same; and they are ready
     To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
     Where you shall hold your session. At this time
     We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
     And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
     By those that feel their sharpness:
     The question of Cordelia and her father
     Requires a fitter place.
ALBANY
     Sir, by your patience,
     I hold you but a subject of this war,
     Not as a brother.
REGAN
     That's as we list to grace him.
     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
     Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
     Bore the commission of my place and person;
     The which immediacy may well stand up,
     And call itself your brother.
GONERIL
     Not so hot:
     In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
     More than in your addition.
REGAN
     In my rights,
     By me invested, he compeers the best.
GONERIL
     That were the most, if he should husband you.
REGAN
     Jesters do oft prove prophets.
GONERIL
     Holla, holla!
     That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.
REGAN
     Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
     From a full-flowing stomach. General,
     Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
     Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
     Witness the world, that I create thee here
     My lord and master.
GONERIL
     Mean you to enjoy him?
ALBANY
     The let-alone lies not in your good will.
EDMUND
     Nor in thine, lord.
ALBANY
     Half-blooded fellow, yes.
REGAN
     [To EDMUND] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
ALBANY
     Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
     On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
     This gilded serpent
     Pointing to Goneril
     For your claim, fair sister,
     I bar it in the interest of my wife:
     'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
     And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
     If you will marry, make your loves to me,
     My lady is bespoke.
GONERIL
     An interlude!
ALBANY
     Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
     If none appear to prove upon thy head
     Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
     There is my pledge;
     Throwing down a glove
     I'll prove it on thy heart,
     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
     Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
REGAN
     Sick, O, sick!
GONERIL
     [Aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
EDMUND
     There's my exchange:
     Throwing down a glove
     what in the world he is
     That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
     Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
     My truth and honour firmly.
ALBANY
     A herald, ho!
EDMUND
     A herald, ho, a herald!
ALBANY
     Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
     All levied in my name, have in my name
     Took their discharge.
REGAN
     My sickness grows upon me.
ALBANY
     She is not well; convey her to my tent.
     Exit Regan, led
     Enter a Herald
     Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
     And read out this.
Captain
     Sound, trumpet!
     A trumpet sounds
Herald
     [Reads] 'If any man of quality or degree within
     the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
     supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
     traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
     trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'
EDMUND
     Sound!
     First trumpet
Herald
     Again!
     Second trumpet
Herald
     Again!
     Third trumpet
     Trumpet answers within
     Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him
ALBANY
     Ask him his purposes, why he appears
     Upon this call o' the trumpet.
Herald
     What are you?
     Your name, your quality? and why you answer
     This present summons?
EDGAR
     Know, my name is lost;
     By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
     Yet am I noble as the adversary
     I come to cope.
ALBANY
     Which is that adversary?
EDGAR
     What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
EDMUND
     Himself: what say'st thou to him?
EDGAR
     Draw thy sword,
     That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
     Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
     My oath, and my profession: I protest,
     Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
     Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
     Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
     Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
     And, from the extremest upward of thy head
     To the descent and dust below thy foot,
     A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
     This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
     Thou liest.
EDMUND
     In wisdom I should ask thy name;
     But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
     What safe and nicely I might well delay
     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
     Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
     With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
     Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
     This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
     Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
     Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls
ALBANY
     Save him, save him!
GONERIL
     This is practise, Gloucester:
     By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
     An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
     But cozen'd and beguiled.
ALBANY
     Shut your mouth, dame,
     Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
     Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
     No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.
     Gives the letter to EDMUND
GONERIL
     Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
     Who can arraign me for't.
ALBANY
     Most monstrous! oh!
     Know'st thou this paper?
GONERIL
     Ask me not what I know.
     Exit
ALBANY
     Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
EDMUND
     What you have charged me with, that have I done;
     And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
     'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
     That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
     I do forgive thee.
EDGAR
     Let's exchange charity.
     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
     If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
     My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
     The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
     Make instruments to plague us:
     The dark and vicious place where thee he got
     Cost him his eyes.
EDMUND
     Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
     The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
ALBANY
     Methought thy very gait did prophesy
     A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
     Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
     Did hate thee or thy father!
EDGAR
     Worthy prince, I know't.
ALBANY
     Where have you hid yourself?
     How have you known the miseries of your father?
EDGAR
     By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
     And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
     The bloody proclamation to escape,
     That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
     That we the pain of death would hourly die
     Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
     Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
     That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
     Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
     Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
     Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
     Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
     Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
     I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
     Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
     Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
     'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
     Burst smilingly.
EDMUND
     This speech of yours hath moved me,
     And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
     You look as you had something more to say.
ALBANY
     If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
     For I am almost ready to dissolve,
     Hearing of this.
EDGAR
     This would have seem'd a period
     To such as love not sorrow; but another,
     To amplify too much, would make much more,
     And top extremity.
     Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
     Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
     Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
     Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
     He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
     As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
     Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
     That ever ear received: which in recounting
     His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
     Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
     And there I left him tranced.
ALBANY
     But who was this?
EDGAR
     Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
     Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
     Improper for a slave.
     Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife
Gentleman
     Help, help, O, help!
EDGAR
     What kind of help?
ALBANY
     Speak, man.
EDGAR
     What means that bloody knife?
Gentleman
     'Tis hot, it smokes;
     It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
ALBANY
     Who dead? speak, man.
Gentleman
     Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
     By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
EDMUND
     I was contracted to them both: all three
     Now marry in an instant.
EDGAR
     Here comes Kent.
ALBANY
     Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
     This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
     Touches us not with pity.
     Exit Gentleman
     Enter KENT
     O, is this he?
     The time will not allow the compliment
     Which very manners urges.
KENT
     I am come
     To bid my king and master aye good night:
     Is he not here?
ALBANY
     Great thing of us forgot!
     Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
     See'st thou this object, Kent?
     The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
KENT
     Alack, why thus?
EDMUND
     Yet Edmund was beloved:
     The one the other poison'd for my sake,
     And after slew herself.
ALBANY
     Even so. Cover their faces.
EDMUND
     I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
     Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
     Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
     Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
     Nay, send in time.
ALBANY
     Run, run, O, run!
EDGAR
     To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
     Thy token of reprieve.
EDMUND
     Well thought on: take my sword,
     Give it the captain.
ALBANY
     Haste thee, for thy life.
     Exit EDGAR
EDMUND
     He hath commission from thy wife and me
     To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
     To lay the blame upon her own despair,
     That she fordid herself.
ALBANY
     The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
     EDMUND is borne off
     Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain,
     and others following
KING LEAR
     Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
     Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
     That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
     I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
     She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
     Why, then she lives.
KENT
     Is this the promised end
EDGAR
     Or image of that horror?
ALBANY
     Fall, and cease!
KING LEAR
     This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
     It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
     That ever I have felt.
KENT
     [Kneeling] O my good master!
KING LEAR
     Prithee, away.
EDGAR
     'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
KING LEAR
     A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
     I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
     Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
     What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
     Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
     I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
Captain
     'Tis true, my lords, he did.
KING LEAR
     Did I not, fellow?
     I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
     I would have made them skip: I am old now,
     And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
     Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
KENT
     If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
     One of them we behold.
KING LEAR
     This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
KENT
     The same,
     Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
KING LEAR
     He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
     He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
KENT
     No, my good lord; I am the very man,--
KING LEAR
     I'll see that straight.
KENT
     That, from your first of difference and decay,
     Have follow'd your sad steps.
KING LEAR
     You are welcome hither.
KENT
     Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
     Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
     And desperately are dead.
KING LEAR
     Ay, so I think.
ALBANY
     He knows not what he says: and vain it is
     That we present us to him.
EDGAR
     Very bootless.
     Enter a Captain
Captain
     Edmund is dead, my lord.
ALBANY
     That's but a trifle here.
     You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
     What comfort to this great decay may come
     Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
     During the life of this old majesty,
     To him our absolute power:
     To EDGAR and KENT
     you, to your rights:
     With boot, and such addition as your honours
     Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
     The wages of their virtue, and all foes
     The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
KING LEAR
     And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
     Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
     And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
     Never, never, never, never, never!
     Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
     Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
     Look there, look there!
     Dies
EDGAR
     He faints! My lord, my lord!
KENT
     Break, heart; I prithee, break!
EDGAR
     Look up, my lord.
KENT
     Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
     That would upon the rack of this tough world
     Stretch him out longer.
EDGAR
     He is gone, indeed.
KENT
     The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
     He but usurp'd his life.
ALBANY
     Bear them from hence. Our present business
     Is general woe.
     To KENT and EDGAR
     Friends of my soul, you twain
     Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
KENT
     I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
     My master calls me, I must not say no.
ALBANY
     The weight of this sad time we must obey;
     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
     The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
     Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
     Exeunt, with a dead march
The First part of King Henry the Sixth
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. Westminster Abbey. ****
     Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the Fifth, attended on by
     Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and
     EXETER, Earl of WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, & c
BEDFORD
     Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
     Comets, importing change of times and states,
     Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
     And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
     That have consented unto Henry's death!
     King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
     England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
GLOUCESTER
     England ne'er had a king until his time.
     Virtue he had, deserving to command:
     His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
     His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
     His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
     More dazzled and drove back his enemies
     Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
     What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
     He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
EXETER
     We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
     Henry is dead and never shall revive:
     Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
     And death's dishonourable victory
     We with our stately presence glorify,
     Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
     What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
     That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
     Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
     Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him
     By magic verses have contrived his end?
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
     Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
     So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
     The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
     The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
GLOUCESTER
     The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,
     His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
     None do you like but an effeminate prince,
     Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector
     And lookest to command the prince and realm.
     Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
     More than God or religious churchmen may.
GLOUCESTER
     Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,
     And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
     Except it be to pray against thy foes.
BEDFORD
     Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
     Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
     Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:
     Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
     Posterity, await for wretched years,
     When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
     Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
     And none but women left to wail the dead.
     Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:
     Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
     Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
     A far more glorious star thy soul will make
     Than Julius Caesar or bright--
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     My honourable lords, health to you all!
     Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
     Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:
     Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,
     Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
BEDFORD
     What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
     Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
     Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
GLOUCESTER
     Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
     If Henry were recall'd to life again,
     These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
EXETER
     How were they lost? what treachery was used?
Messenger
     No treachery; but want of men and money.
     Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,
     That here you maintain several factions,
     And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
     You are disputing of your generals:
     One would have lingering wars with little cost;
     Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
     A third thinks, without expense at all,
     By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
     Awake, awake, English nobility!
     Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:
     Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
     Of England's coat one half is cut away.
EXETER
     Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
     These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
BEDFORD
     Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
     Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
     Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
     Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
     To weep their intermissive miseries.
     Enter to them another Messenger
Messenger
     Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.
     France is revolted from the English quite,
     Except some petty towns of no import:
     The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;
     The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
     Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
     The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.
EXETER
     The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
     O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
GLOUCESTER
     We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
     Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
BEDFORD
     Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
     An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
     Wherewith already France is overrun.
     Enter another Messenger
Messenger
     My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
     Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
     I must inform you of a dismal fight
     Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
Messenger
     O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:
     The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
     The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
     Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
     Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
     By three and twenty thousand of the French
     Was round encompassed and set upon.
     No leisure had he to enrank his men;
     He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
     Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
     They pitched in the ground confusedly,
     To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
     More than three hours the fight continued;
     Where valiant Talbot above human thought
     Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
     Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
     Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:
     The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;
     All the whole army stood agazed on him:
     His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
     A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
     And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
     Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
     If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:
     He, being in the vaward, placed behind
     With purpose to relieve and follow them,
     Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
     Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;
     Enclosed were they with their enemies:
     A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
     Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
     Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
     Durst not presume to look once in the face.
BEDFORD
     Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
     For living idly here in pomp and ease,
     Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
     Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
Messenger
     O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,
     And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:
     Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
BEDFORD
     His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
     I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:
     His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
     Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
     Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
     Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
     To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
     Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
     Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
Messenger
     So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;
     The English army is grown weak and faint:
     The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
     And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
     Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
EXETER
     Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
     Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
     Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
BEDFORD
     I do remember it; and here take my leave,
     To go about my preparation.
     Exit
GLOUCESTER
     I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,
     To view the artillery and munition;
     And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
     Exit
EXETER
     To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
     Being ordain'd his special governor,
     And for his safety there I'll best devise.
     Exit
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Each hath his place and function to attend:
     I am left out; for me nothing remains.
     But long I will not be Jack out of office:
     The king from Eltham I intend to steal
     And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. France. Before Orleans. ****
     Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, marching with
     drum and Soldiers
CHARLES
     Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
     So in the earth, to this day is not known:
     Late did he shine upon the English side;
     Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
     What towns of any moment but we have?
     At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
     Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
     Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
ALENCON
     They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
     Either they must be dieted like mules
     And have their provender tied to their mouths
     Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
REIGNIER
     Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
     Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:
     Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;
     And he may well in fretting spend his gall,
     Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
CHARLES
     Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
     Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
     Him I forgive my death that killeth me
     When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
     Exeunt
     Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-
     enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER
CHARLES
     Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
     Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,
     But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
REIGNIER
     Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
     He fighteth as one weary of his life.
     The other lords, like lions wanting food,
     Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
ALENCON
     Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
     England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
     During the time Edward the Third did reign.
     More truly now may this be verified;
     For none but Samsons and Goliases
     It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
     Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose
     They had such courage and audacity?
CHARLES
     Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
     And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
     Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
     The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
REIGNIER
     I think, by some odd gimmors or device
     Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;
     Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
     By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
ALENCON
     Be it so.
     Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
CHARLES
     Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:
     Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
     Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:
     A holy maid hither with me I bring,
     Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
     Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
     And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
     The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
     Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
     What's past and what's to come she can descry.
     Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
     For they are certain and unfallible.
CHARLES
     Go, call her in.
     Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     But first, to try her skill,
     Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
     Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
     By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
     Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE
REIGNIER
     Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
     Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
     I know thee well, though never seen before.
     Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:
     In private will I talk with thee apart.
     Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
REIGNIER
     She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
     My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
     Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
     To shine on my contemptible estate:
     Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
     And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
     God's mother deigned to appear to me
     And in a vision full of majesty
     Will'd me to leave my base vocation
     And free my country from calamity:
     Her aid she promised and assured success:
     In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
     And, whereas I was black and swart before,
     With those clear rays which she infused on me
     That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
     Ask me what question thou canst possible,
     And I will answer unpremeditated:
     My courage try by combat, if thou darest,
     And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
     Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
     If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
CHARLES
     Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
     Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
     In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
     And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
     Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,
     Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;
     The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's
     churchyard,
     Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
CHARLES
     Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
     Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes
CHARLES
     Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon
     And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
CHARLES
     Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
     Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
     My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
     Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
     Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
     'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     I must not yield to any rites of love,
     For my profession's sacred from above:
     When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
     Then will I think upon a recompense.
CHARLES
     Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
REIGNIER
     My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
ALENCON
     Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
     Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
REIGNIER
     Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
ALENCON
     He may mean more than we poor men do know:
     These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
REIGNIER
     My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
     Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
     Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
CHARLES
     What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
     This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
     Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
     Since I have entered into these wars.
     Glory is like a circle in the water,
     Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
     Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
     With Henry's death the English circle ends;
     Dispersed are the glories it included.
     Now am I like that proud insulting ship
     Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
CHARLES
     Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
     Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
     Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
     Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.
     Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
     How may I reverently worship thee enough?
ALENCON
     Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
REIGNIER
     Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;
     Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
CHARLES
     Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:
     No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. London. Before the Tower. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats
GLOUCESTER
     I am come to survey the Tower this day:
     Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
     Where be these warders, that they wait not here?
     Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.
First Warder
     [Within] Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
     First Serving-Man It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.
Second Warder
     [Within] Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.
     First Serving-Man Villains, answer you so the lord protector?
First Warder
     [Within] The Lord protect him! so we answer him:
     We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
GLOUCESTER
     Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
     There's none protector of the realm but I.
     Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.
     Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
     Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and WOODVILE the Lieutenant
     speaks within
WOODVILE
     What noise is this? what traitors have we here?
GLOUCESTER
     Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
     Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.
WOODVILE
     Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;
     The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:
     From him I have express commandment
     That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
GLOUCESTER
     Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?
     Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,
     Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
     Thou art no friend to God or to the king:
     Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
     Serving-Men Open the gates unto the lord protector,
     Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
     Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and
     his men in tawny coats
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
GLOUCESTER
     Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     I do, thou most usurping proditor,
     And not protector, of the king or realm.
GLOUCESTER
     Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
     Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;
     Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:
     I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
     If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:
     This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,
     To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
GLOUCESTER
     I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:
     Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
     I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.
GLOUCESTER
     What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
     Draw, men, for all this privileged place;
     Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,
     I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:
     Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:
     In spite of pope or dignities of church,
     Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.
GLOUCESTER
     Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!
     Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
     Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
     Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!
     Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF WINCHESTER's men, and enter
     in the hurly- burly the Mayor of London and his Officers
Mayor
     Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
     Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
GLOUCESTER
     Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
     Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
     Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
     One that still motions war and never peace,
     O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,
     That seeks to overthrow religion,
     Because he is protector of the realm,
     And would have armour here out of the Tower,
     To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
GLOUCESTER
     I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
     Here they skirmish again
Mayor
     Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
     But to make open proclamation:
     Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,
     Cry.
Officer
     All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
     against God's peace and the king's, we charge and
     command you, in his highness' name, to repair to
     your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,
     handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,
     henceforward, upon pain of death.
GLOUCESTER
     Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:
     But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:
     Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
Mayor
     I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.
     This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
GLOUCESTER
     Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;
     For I intend to have it ere long.
     Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their
     Serving-men
Mayor
     See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
     Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
     I myself fight not once in forty year.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Orleans. ****
     Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy
     Master-Gunner Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,
     And how the English have the suburbs won.
Boy
     Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,
     Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
     Master-Gunner But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:
     Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
     Something I must do to procure me grace.
     The prince's espials have informed me
     How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,
     Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
     In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
     And thence discover how with most advantage
     They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
     To intercept this inconvenience,
     A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;
     And even these three days have I watch'd,
     If I could see them.
     Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.
     If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
     And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
     Exit
Boy
     Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
     I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.
     Exit
     Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT, GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and
     others
SALISBURY
     Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
     How wert thou handled being prisoner?
     Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
     Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
TALBOT
     The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
     Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
     For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
     But with a baser man of arms by far
     Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
     Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,
     Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
     In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.
     But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,
     Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
     If I now had him brought into my power.
SALISBURY
     Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
TALBOT
     With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
     In open market-place produced they me,
     To be a public spectacle to all:
     Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
     The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
     Then broke I from the officers that led me,
     And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,
     To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
     My grisly countenance made others fly;
     None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
     In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
     So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,
     That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
     And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
     Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
     That walked about me every minute-while;
     And if I did but stir out of my bed,
     Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
     Enter the Boy with a linstock
SALISBURY
     I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
     But we will be revenged sufficiently
     Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
     Here, through this grate, I count each one
     and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
     Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
     Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
     Let me have your express opinions
     Where is best place to make our battery next.
GARGRAVE
     I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.
GLANSDALE
     And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
TALBOT
     For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,
     Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
     Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall
SALISBURY
     O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
GARGRAVE
     O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
TALBOT
     What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
     Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
     How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?
     One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
     Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
     That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
     In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
     Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
     Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,
     His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
     Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
     One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:
     The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
     Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
     If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
     Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
     Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
     Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
     Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
     Thou shalt not die whiles--
     He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
     As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
     Remember to avenge me on the French.'
     Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
     Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
     Wretched shall France be only in my name.
     Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens
     What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
     Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:
     The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,
     A holy prophetess new risen up,
     Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
     Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans
TALBOT
     Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
     It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
     Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:
     Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
     Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,
     And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
     Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
     And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
     Alarum. Exeunt
**** SCENE V. The same. ****
     Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the DAUPHIN, and driveth
     him: then enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and
     exit after them then re-enter TALBOT
TALBOT
     Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
     Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:
     A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
     Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;
     Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:
     Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,
     And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.
     Here they fight
TALBOT
     Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
     My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
     And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
     But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
     They fight again
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:
     I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
     A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers
     O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.
     Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;
     Help Salisbury to make his testament:
     This day is ours, as many more shall be.
     Exit
TALBOT
     My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
     I know not where I am, nor what I do;
     A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
     Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:
     So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
     Are from their hives and houses driven away.
     They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;
     Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
     A short alarum
     Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,
     Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
     Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
     Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
     Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
     As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
     Alarum. Here another skirmish
     It will not be: retire into your trenches:
     You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
     For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
     Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,
     In spite of us or aught that we could do.
     O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
     The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
     Exit TALBOT. Alarum; retreat; flourish
**** SCENE VI. The same. ****
     Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and
     Soldiers
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Advance our waving colours on the walls;
     Rescued is Orleans from the English
     Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
CHARLES
     Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,
     How shall I honour thee for this success?
     Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
     That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
     France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
     Recover'd is the town of Orleans:
     More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
REIGNIER
     Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
     Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires
     And feast and banquet in the open streets,
     To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
ALENCON
     All France will be replete with mirth and joy,
     When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
CHARLES
     'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;
     For which I will divide my crown with her,
     And all the priests and friars in my realm
     Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
     A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
     Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:
     In memory of her when she is dead,
     Her ashes, in an urn more precious
     Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,
     Transported shall be at high festivals
     Before the kings and queens of France.
     No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
     But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
     Come in, and let us banquet royally,
     After this golden day of victory.
     Flourish. Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. Before Orleans. ****
     Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels
Sergeant
     Sirs, take your places and be vigilant:
     If any noise or soldier you perceive
     Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
     Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
First Sentinel
     Sergeant, you shall.
     Exit Sergeant
     Thus are poor servitors,
     When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
     Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.
     Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders,
     their drums beating a dead march
TALBOT
     Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,
     By whose approach the regions of Artois,
     Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,
     This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,
     Having all day caroused and banqueted:
     Embrace we then this opportunity
     As fitting best to quittance their deceit
     Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.
BEDFORD
     Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,
     Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,
     To join with witches and the help of hell!
BURGUNDY
     Traitors have never other company.
     But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
TALBOT
     A maid, they say.
BEDFORD
     A maid! and be so martial!
BURGUNDY
     Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
     If underneath the standard of the French
     She carry armour as she hath begun.
TALBOT
     Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:
     God is our fortress, in whose conquering name
     Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
BEDFORD
     Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.
TALBOT
     Not all together: better far, I guess,
     That we do make our entrance several ways;
     That, if it chance the one of us do fail,
     The other yet may rise against their force.
BEDFORD
     Agreed: I'll to yond corner.
BURGUNDY
     And I to this.
TALBOT
     And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
     Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
     Of English Henry, shall this night appear
     How much in duty I am bound to both.
Sentinels
     Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
     Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.'
     The French leap over the walls in their shirts. Enter, several ways,
     the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half
     unready
ALENCON
     How now, my lords! what, all unready so?
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
REIGNIER
     'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
     Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
ALENCON
     Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
     Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
     More venturous or desperate than this.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
REIGNIER
     If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.
ALENCON
     Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.
     Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE
CHARLES
     Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
     Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
     Make us partakers of a little gain,
     That now our loss might be ten times so much?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
     At all times will you have my power alike?
     Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
     Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
     Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,
     This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
CHARLES
     Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
     That, being captain of the watch to-night,
     Did look no better to that weighty charge.
ALENCON
     Had all your quarters been as safely kept
     As that whereof I had the government,
     We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Mine was secure.
REIGNIER
     And so was mine, my lord.
CHARLES
     And, for myself, most part of all this night,
     Within her quarter and mine own precinct
     I was employ'd in passing to and fro,
     About relieving of the sentinels:
     Then how or which way should they first break in?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Question, my lords, no further of the case,
     How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
     But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
     And now there rests no other shift but this;
     To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,
     And lay new platforms to endamage them.
     Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A Talbot! a Talbot!' They
     fly, leaving their clothes behind
Soldier
     I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
     The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;
     For I have loaden me with many spoils,
     Using no other weapon but his name.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town. ****
     Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others
BEDFORD
     The day begins to break, and night is fled,
     Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
     Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.
     Retreat sounded
TALBOT
     Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,
     And here advance it in the market-place,
     The middle centre of this cursed town.
     Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
     For every drop of blood was drawn from him,
     There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
     And that hereafter ages may behold
     What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,
     Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
     A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:
     Upon the which, that every one may read,
     Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,
     The treacherous manner of his mournful death
     And what a terror he had been to France.
     But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
     I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
     His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
     Nor any of his false confederates.
BEDFORD
     'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
     Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
     They did amongst the troops of armed men
     Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
BURGUNDY
     Myself, as far as I could well discern
     For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
     Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
     When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
     Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
     That could not live asunder day or night.
     After that things are set in order here,
     We'll follow them with all the power we have.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     All hail, my lords! which of this princely train
     Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts
     So much applauded through the realm of France?
TALBOT
     Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
Messenger
     The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
     With modesty admiring thy renown,
     By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
     To visit her poor castle where she lies,
     That she may boast she hath beheld the man
     Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
BURGUNDY
     Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
     Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
     When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
     You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
TALBOT
     Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
     Could not prevail with all their oratory,
     Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:
     And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
     And in submission will attend on her.
     Will not your honours bear me company?
BEDFORD
     No, truly; it is more than manners will:
     And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
     Are often welcomest when they are gone.
TALBOT
     Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,
     I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
     Come hither, captain.
     Whispers
     You perceive my mind?
Captain
     I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle. ****
     Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     Porter, remember what I gave in charge;
     And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.
Porter
     Madam, I will.
     Exit
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,
     I shall as famous be by this exploit
     As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
     Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
     And his achievements of no less account:
     Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,
     To give their censure of these rare reports.
     Enter Messenger and TALBOT
Messenger
     Madam,
     According as your ladyship desired,
     By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
Messenger
     Madam, it is.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     Is this the scourge of France?
     Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
     That with his name the mothers still their babes?
     I see report is fabulous and false:
     I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
     A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
     And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
     Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
     It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
     Should strike such terror to his enemies.
TALBOT
     Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;
     But since your ladyship is not at leisure,
     I'll sort some other time to visit you.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
Messenger
     Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
     To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
TALBOT
     Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
     I go to certify her Talbot's here.
     Re-enter Porter with keys
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.
TALBOT
     Prisoner! to whom?
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     To me, blood-thirsty lord;
     And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
     Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
     For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
     But now the substance shall endure the like,
     And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
     That hast by tyranny these many years
     Wasted our country, slain our citizens
     And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
TALBOT
     Ha, ha, ha!
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
TALBOT
     I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
     To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
     Whereon to practise your severity.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     Why, art not thou the man?
TALBOT
     I am indeed.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     Then have I substance too.
TALBOT
     No, no, I am but shadow of myself:
     You are deceived, my substance is not here;
     For what you see is but the smallest part
     And least proportion of humanity:
     I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
     It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
     Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
     He will be here, and yet he is not here:
     How can these contrarieties agree?
TALBOT
     That will I show you presently.
     Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers
     How say you, madam? are you now persuaded
     That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
     These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,
     With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
     Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
     And in a moment makes them desolate.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
     I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
     And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
     Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
     For I am sorry that with reverence
     I did not entertain thee as thou art.
TALBOT
     Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue
     The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake
     The outward composition of his body.
     What you have done hath not offended me;
     Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
     But only, with your patience, that we may
     Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;
     For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
     COUNTESS
OF AUVERGNE
     With all my heart, and think me honoured
     To feast so great a warrior in my house.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden. ****
     Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK; RICHARD
     PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?
     Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
SUFFOLK
     Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;
     The garden here is more convenient.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;
     Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
SUFFOLK
     Faith, I have been a truant in the law,
     And never yet could frame my will to it;
     And therefore frame the law unto my will.
SOMERSET
     Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
WARWICK
     Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;
     Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
     Between two blades, which bears the better temper:
     Between two horses, which doth bear him best;
     Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;
     I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;
     But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
     Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:
     The truth appears so naked on my side
     That any purblind eye may find it out.
SOMERSET
     And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
     So clear, so shining and so evident
     That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
     In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
     Let him that is a true-born gentleman
     And stands upon the honour of his birth,
     If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
     From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
SOMERSET
     Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
     But dare maintain the party of the truth,
     Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
WARWICK
     I love no colours, and without all colour
     Of base insinuating flattery
     I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
SUFFOLK
     I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
     And say withal I think he held the right.
VERNON
     Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
     Till you conclude that he upon whose side
     The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
     Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
SOMERSET
     Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
     If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     And I.
VERNON
     Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
     I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
     Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
SOMERSET
     Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
     Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
     And fall on my side so, against your will.
VERNON
     If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,
     Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
     And keep me on the side where still I am.
SOMERSET
     Well, well, come on: who else?
Lawyer
     Unless my study and my books be false,
     The argument you held was wrong in you:
     To SOMERSET
     In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
SOMERSET
     Here in my scabbard, meditating that
     Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
     For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
     The truth on our side.
SOMERSET
     No, Plantagenet,
     'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
     Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
     And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
SOMERSET
     Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
     Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
SOMERSET
     Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
     That shall maintain what I have said is true,
     Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
     I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
SUFFOLK
     Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
SUFFOLK
     I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
SOMERSET
     Away, away, good William de la Pole!
     We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
WARWICK
     Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;
     His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,
     Third son to the third Edward King of England:
     Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     He bears him on the place's privilege,
     Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
SOMERSET
     By him that made me, I'll maintain my words
     On any plot of ground in Christendom.
     Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
     For treason executed in our late king's days?
     And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,
     Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
     His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
     And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     My father was attached, not attainted,
     Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
     And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
     Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
     For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
     I'll note you in my book of memory,
     To scourge you for this apprehension:
     Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
SOMERSET
     Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
     And know us by these colours for thy foes,
     For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
     As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
     Will I for ever and my faction wear,
     Until it wither with me to my grave
     Or flourish to the height of my degree.
SUFFOLK
     Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!
     And so farewell until I meet thee next.
     Exit
SOMERSET
     Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.
     Exit
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     How I am braved and must perforce endure it!
WARWICK
     This blot that they object against your house
     Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
     Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
     And if thou be not then created York,
     I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
     Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
     Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
     Will I upon thy party wear this rose:
     And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
     Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,
     Shall send between the red rose and the white
     A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
     That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
VERNON
     In your behalf still will I wear the same.
Lawyer
     And so will I.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Thanks, gentle sir.
     Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say
     This quarrel will drink blood another day.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. The Tower of London. ****
     Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers
MORTIMER
     Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
     Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
     Even like a man new haled from the rack,
     So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
     And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
     Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
     Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
     These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
     Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
     Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,
     And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine
     That droops his sapless branches to the ground;
     Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
     Unable to support this lump of clay,
     Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
     As witting I no other comfort have.
     But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
First Gaoler
     Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
     We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;
     And answer was return'd that he will come.
MORTIMER
     Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
     Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
     Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
     Before whose glory I was great in arms,
     This loathsome sequestration have I had:
     And even since then hath Richard been obscured,
     Deprived of honour and inheritance.
     But now the arbitrator of despairs,
     Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
     With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
     I would his troubles likewise were expired,
     That so he might recover what was lost.
     Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
First Gaoler
     My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
MORTIMER
     Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
     Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
MORTIMER
     Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
     And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:
     O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
     That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
     And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
     Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
     And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
     This day, in argument upon a case,
     Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
     Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
     And did upbraid me with my father's death:
     Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
     Else with the like I had requited him.
     Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
     In honour of a true Plantagenet
     And for alliance sake, declare the cause
     My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
MORTIMER
     That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me
     And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
     Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
     Was cursed instrument of his decease.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Discover more at large what cause that was,
     For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
MORTIMER
     I will, if that my fading breath permit
     And death approach not ere my tale be done.
     Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
     Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
     The first-begotten and the lawful heir,
     Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
     During whose reign the Percies of the north,
     Finding his usurpation most unjust,
     Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
     The reason moved these warlike lords to this
     Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
     Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
     I was the next by birth and parentage;
     For by my mother I derived am
     From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
     To King Edward the Third; whereas he
     From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
     Being but fourth of that heroic line.
     But mark: as in this haughty attempt
     They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
     I lost my liberty and they their lives.
     Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
     Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
     Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived
     From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
     Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
     Again in pity of my hard distress
     Levied an army, weening to redeem
     And have install'd me in the diadem:
     But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
     And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
     In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
MORTIMER
     True; and thou seest that I no issue have
     And that my fainting words do warrant death;
     Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:
     But yet be wary in thy studious care.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:
     But yet, methinks, my father's execution
     Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
MORTIMER
     With silence, nephew, be thou politic:
     Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
     And like a mountain, not to be removed.
     But now thy uncle is removing hence:
     As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd
     With long continuance in a settled place.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     O, uncle, would some part of my young years
     Might but redeem the passage of your age!
MORTIMER
     Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
     Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
     Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
     Only give order for my funeral:
     And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes
     And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!
     Dies
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!
     In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
     And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
     Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;
     And what I do imagine let that rest.
     Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
     Will see his burial better than his life.
     Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER
     Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,
     Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
     And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
     Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:
     I doubt not but with honour to redress;
     And therefore haste I to the parliament,
     Either to be restored to my blood,
     Or make my ill the advantage of my good.
     Exit
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, SOMERSET,
     and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and
     others. GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF WINCHESTER
     snatches it, and tears it
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,
     With written pamphlets studiously devised,
     Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
     Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
     Do it without invention, suddenly;
     As I with sudden and extemporal speech
     Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
GLOUCESTER
     Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,
     Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
     Think not, although in writing I preferr'd
     The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
     That therefore I have forged, or am not able
     Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
     No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,
     Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,
     As very infants prattle of thy pride.
     Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
     Forward by nature, enemy to peace;
     Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
     A man of thy profession and degree;
     And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?
     In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,
     As well at London bridge as at the Tower.
     Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
     The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
     From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
     To give me hearing what I shall reply.
     If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,
     As he will have me, how am I so poor?
     Or how haps it I seek not to advance
     Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
     And for dissension, who preferreth peace
     More than I do?--except I be provoked.
     No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
     It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
     It is, because no one should sway but he;
     No one but he should be about the king;
     And that engenders thunder in his breast
     And makes him roar these accusations forth.
     But he shall know I am as good--
GLOUCESTER
     As good!
     Thou bastard of my grandfather!
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
     But one imperious in another's throne?
GLOUCESTER
     Am I not protector, saucy priest?
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     And am not I a prelate of the church?
GLOUCESTER
     Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
     And useth it to patronage his theft.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Unreverent Gloster!
GLOUCESTER
     Thou art reverent
     Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Rome shall remedy this.
WARWICK
     Roam thither, then.
SOMERSET
     My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
WARWICK
     Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
SOMERSET
     Methinks my lord should be religious
     And know the office that belongs to such.
WARWICK
     Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
     it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
SOMERSET
     Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
WARWICK
     State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?
     Is not his grace protector to the king?
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     [Aside] Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
     Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
     Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
     Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
KING HENRY VI
     Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,
     The special watchmen of our English weal,
     I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,
     To join your hearts in love and amity.
     O, what a scandal is it to our crown,
     That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
     Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
     Civil dissension is a viperous worm
     That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
     A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!'
     What tumult's this?
WARWICK
     An uproar, I dare warrant,
     Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
     A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor
Mayor
     O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
     Pity the city of London, pity us!
     The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,
     Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
     Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
     And banding themselves in contrary parts
     Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
     That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:
     Our windows are broke down in every street
     And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
     Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates
KING HENRY VI
     We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
     To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.
     Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.
     First Serving-man Nay, if we be forbidden stones,
     We'll fall to it with our teeth.
     Second Serving-man Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.
     Skirmish again
GLOUCESTER
     You of my household, leave this peevish broil
     And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
     Third Serving-man My lord, we know your grace to be a man
     Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,
     Inferior to none but to his majesty:
     And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
     So kind a father of the commonweal,
     To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
     We and our wives and children all will fight
     And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
     First Serving-man Ay, and the very parings of our nails
     Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
     Begin again
GLOUCESTER
     Stay, stay, I say!
     And if you love me, as you say you do,
     Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
KING HENRY VI
     O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!
     Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
     My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
     Who should be pitiful, if you be not?
     Or who should study to prefer a peace.
     If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
WARWICK
     Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;
     Except you mean with obstinate repulse
     To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
     You see what mischief and what murder too
     Hath been enacted through your enmity;
     Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     He shall submit, or I will never yield.
GLOUCESTER
     Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
     Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
     Should ever get that privilege of me.
WARWICK
     Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke
     Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,
     As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:
     Why look you still so stern and tragical?
GLOUCESTER
     Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
KING HENRY VI
     Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
     That malice was a great and grievous sin;
     And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
     But prove a chief offender in the same?
WARWICK
     Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
     For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!
     What, shall a child instruct you what to do?
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;
     Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--
     See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
     This token serveth for a flag of truce
     Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:
     So help me God, as I dissemble not!
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     [Aside] So help me God, as I intend it not!
KING HENRY VI
     O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,
     How joyful am I made by this contract!
     Away, my masters! trouble us no more;
     But join in friendship, as your lords have done.
     First Serving-man Content: I'll to the surgeon's.
     Second Serving-man And so will I.
     Third Serving-man And I will see what physic the tavern affords.
     Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor, & c
WARWICK
     Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,
     Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
     We do exhibit to your majesty.
GLOUCESTER
     Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,
     And if your grace mark every circumstance,
     You have great reason to do Richard right;
     Especially for those occasions
     At Eltham Place I told your majesty.
KING HENRY VI
     And those occasions, uncle, were of force:
     Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is
     That Richard be restored to his blood.
WARWICK
     Let Richard be restored to his blood;
     So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.
KING HENRY VI
     If Richard will be true, not that alone
     But all the whole inheritance I give
     That doth belong unto the house of York,
     From whence you spring by lineal descent.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     Thy humble servant vows obedience
     And humble service till the point of death.
KING HENRY VI
     Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
     And, in reguerdon of that duty done,
     I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:
     Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
     And rise created princely Duke of York.
     RICHARD
PLANTAGENET
     And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
     And as my duty springs, so perish they
     That grudge one thought against your majesty!
ALL
     Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!
SOMERSET
     [Aside] Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!
GLOUCESTER
     Now will it best avail your majesty
     To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:
     The presence of a king engenders love
     Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
     As it disanimates his enemies.
KING HENRY VI
     When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;
     For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
GLOUCESTER
     Your ships already are in readiness.
     Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER
EXETER
     Ay, we may march in England or in France,
     Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
     This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
     Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
     And will at last break out into a flame:
     As fester'd members rot but by degree,
     Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
     So will this base and envious discord breed.
     And now I fear that fatal prophecy
     Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
     Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;
     That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
     And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
     Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
     His days may finish ere that hapless time.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. France. Before Rouen. ****
     Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks upon
     their backs
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,
     Through which our policy must make a breach:
     Take heed, be wary how you place your words;
     Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
     That come to gather money for their corn.
     If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
     And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
     I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
     That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
First Soldier
     Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
     And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
     Therefore we'll knock.
     Knocks
Watch
     [Within] Qui est la?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Paysans, pauvres gens de France;
     Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
Watch
     Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
     Exeunt
     Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, REIGNIER, and forces
CHARLES
     Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
     And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;
     Now she is there, how will she specify
     Where is the best and safest passage in?
REIGNIER
     By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;
     Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,
     No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.
     Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a torch burning
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
     That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,
     But burning fatal to the Talbotites!
     Exit
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;
     The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
CHARLES
     Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
     A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
REIGNIER
     Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;
     Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
     And then do execution on the watch.
     Alarum. Exeunt
     An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion
TALBOT
     France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
     If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
     Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,
     Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
     That hardly we escaped the pride of France.
     Exit
     An alarum: excursions. BEDFORD, brought in sick in a chair. Enter
     TALBOT and BURGUNDY without: within JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD
     OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, on the walls
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
     I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
     Before he'll buy again at such a rate:
     'Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?
BURGUNDY
     Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
     I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
     And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
CHARLES
     Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
BEDFORD
     O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,
     And run a tilt at death within a chair?
TALBOT
     Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
     Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
     Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
     And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
     Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
     Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;
     If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
     The English whisper together in council
     God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
TALBOT
     Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
     To try if that our own be ours or no.
TALBOT
     I speak not to that railing Hecate,
     But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;
     Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
ALENCON
     Signior, no.
TALBOT
     Signior, hang! base muleters of France!
     Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
     And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;
     For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
     God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you
     That we are here.
     Exeunt from the walls
TALBOT
     And there will we be too, ere it be long,
     Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
     Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,
     Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,
     Either to get the town again or die:
     And I, as sure as English Henry lives
     And as his father here was conqueror,
     As sure as in this late-betrayed town
     Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,
     So sure I swear to get the town or die.
BURGUNDY
     My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
TALBOT
     But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,
     The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,
     We will bestow you in some better place,
     Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
BEDFORD
     Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:
     Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
     And will be partner of your weal or woe.
BURGUNDY
     Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.
BEDFORD
     Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
     That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
     Came to the field and vanquished his foes:
     Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
     Because I ever found them as myself.
TALBOT
     Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
     Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
     And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
     But gather we our forces out of hand
     And set upon our boasting enemy.
     Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants
     An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain
Captain
     Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?
FASTOLFE
     Whither away! to save myself by flight:
     We are like to have the overthrow again.
Captain
     What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?
FASTOLFE
     Ay,
     All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!
     Exit
Captain
     Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!
     Exit
     Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE, ALENCON, and CHARLES fly
BEDFORD
     Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
     For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
     What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
     They that of late were daring with their scoffs
     Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
     BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair
     An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest
TALBOT
     Lost, and recover'd in a day again!
     This is a double honour, Burgundy:
     Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
BURGUNDY
     Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
     Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
     Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.
TALBOT
     Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?
     I think her old familiar is asleep:
     Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?
     What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief
     That such a valiant company are fled.
     Now will we take some order in the town,
     Placing therein some expert officers,
     And then depart to Paris to the king,
     For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
BURGUNDY
     What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
TALBOT
     But yet, before we go, let's not forget
     The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,
     But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:
     A braver soldier never couched lance,
     A gentler heart did never sway in court;
     But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
     For that's the end of human misery.

     Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and
     forces
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
     Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
     Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,
     For things that are not to be remedied.
     Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
     And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
     We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,
     If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.
CHARLES
     We have been guided by thee hitherto,
     And of thy cunning had no diffidence:
     One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Search out thy wit for secret policies,
     And we will make thee famous through the world.
ALENCON
     We'll set thy statue in some holy place,
     And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
     Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
     By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
     We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
     To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
CHARLES
     Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
     France were no place for Henry's warriors;
     Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
     But be extirped from our provinces.
ALENCON
     For ever should they be expulsed from France
     And not have title of an earldom here.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Your honours shall perceive how I will work
     To bring this matter to the wished end.
     Drum sounds afar off
     Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
     Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
     Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over at a distance,
     TALBOT and his forces
     There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,
     And all the troops of English after him.
     French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces
     Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
     Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
     Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
     Trumpets sound a parley
CHARLES
     A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
BURGUNDY
     Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.
BURGUNDY
     What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.
CHARLES
     Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!
     Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.
BURGUNDY
     Speak on; but be not over-tedious.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
     And see the cities and the towns defaced
     By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
     As looks the mother on her lowly babe
     When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
     See, see the pining malady of France;
     Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
     Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.
     O, turn thy edged sword another way;
     Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
     One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
     Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
     Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
     And wash away thy country's stained spots.
BURGUNDY
     Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
     Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
     Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
     Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
     That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
     When Talbot hath set footing once in France
     And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
     Who then but English Henry will be lord
     And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
     Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
     Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?
     And was he not in England prisoner?
     But when they heard he was thine enemy,
     They set him free without his ransom paid,
     In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
     See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen
     And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
     Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:
     Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
BURGUNDY
     I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
     Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,
     And made me almost yield upon my knees.
     Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,
     And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:
     My forces and my power of men are yours:
     So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     [Aside] Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!
CHARLES
     Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
ALENCON
     Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,
     And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
CHARLES
     Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
     And seek how we may prejudice the foe.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Paris. The palace. ****
     Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK,
     SOMERSET, WARWICK, EXETER, VERNON BASSET, and others. To them with
     his Soldiers, TALBOT
TALBOT
     My gracious prince, and honourable peers,
     Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
     I have awhile given truce unto my wars,
     To do my duty to my sovereign:
     In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd
     To your obedience fifty fortresses,
     Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,
     Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
     Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,
     And with submissive loyalty of heart
     Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
     First to my God and next unto your grace.
     Kneels
KING HENRY VI
     Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,
     That hath so long been resident in France?
GLOUCESTER
     Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
KING HENRY VI
     Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
     When I was young, as yet I am not old,
     I do remember how my father said
     A stouter champion never handled sword.
     Long since we were resolved of your truth,
     Your faithful service and your toil in war;
     Yet never have you tasted our reward,
     Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,
     Because till now we never saw your face:
     Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,
     We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;
     And in our coronation take your place.
     Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET
VERNON
     Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
     Disgracing of these colours that I wear
     In honour of my noble Lord of York:
     Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?
BASSET
     Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage
     The envious barking of your saucy tongue
     Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
VERNON
     Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
BASSET
     Why, what is he? as good a man as York.
VERNON
     Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.
     Strikes him
BASSET
     Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
     That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,
     Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
     But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
     I may have liberty to venge this wrong;
     When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
VERNON
     Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;
     And, after, meet you sooner than you would.
     Exeunt
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. Paris. A hall of state. ****
     Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK,
     SOMERSET, WARWICK, TALBOT, EXETER, the Governor, of Paris, and others
GLOUCESTER
     Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.
     BISHOP
OF WINCHESTER
     God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!
GLOUCESTER
     Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,
     That you elect no other king but him;
     Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
     And none your foes but such as shall pretend
     Malicious practises against his state:
     This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!
     Enter FASTOLFE
FASTOLFE
     My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,
     To haste unto your coronation,
     A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
     Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.
TALBOT
     Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
     I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
     To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,
     Plucking it off
     Which I have done, because unworthily
     Thou wast installed in that high degree.
     Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest
     This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
     When but in all I was six thousand strong
     And that the French were almost ten to one,
     Before we met or that a stroke was given,
     Like to a trusty squire did run away:
     In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
     Myself and divers gentlemen beside
     Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
     Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
     Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
     This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.
GLOUCESTER
     To say the truth, this fact was infamous
     And ill beseeming any common man,
     Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.
TALBOT
     When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
     Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
     Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
     Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
     Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
     But always resolute in most extremes.
     He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
     Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
     Profaning this most honourable order,
     And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
     Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
     That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
KING HENRY VI
     Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
     Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:
     Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.
     Exit FASTOLFE
     And now, my lord protector, view the letter
     Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
GLOUCESTER
     What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?
     No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'
     Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
     Or doth this churlish superscription
     Pretend some alteration in good will?
     What's here?
     Reads
     'I have, upon especial cause,
     Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
     Together with the pitiful complaints
     Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
     Forsaken your pernicious faction
     And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'
     O monstrous treachery! can this be so,
     That in alliance, amity and oaths,
     There should be found such false dissembling guile?
KING HENRY VI
     What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
GLOUCESTER
     He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
KING HENRY VI
     Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
GLOUCESTER
     It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
     And give him chastisement for this abuse.
     How say you, my lord? are you not content?
TALBOT
     Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,
     I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
KING HENRY VI
     Then gather strength and march unto him straight:
     Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
     And what offence it is to flout his friends.
TALBOT
     I go, my lord, in heart desiring still
     You may behold confusion of your foes.
     Exit
     Enter VERNON and BASSET
VERNON
     Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
BASSET
     And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.
YORK
     This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.
SOMERSET
     And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.
KING HENRY VI
     Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.
     Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?
     And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
VERNON
     With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.
BASSET
     And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
KING HENRY VI
     What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
     First let me know, and then I'll answer you.
BASSET
     Crossing the sea from England into France,
     This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
     Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
     Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
     Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
     When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
     About a certain question in the law
     Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;
     With other vile and ignominious terms:
     In confutation of which rude reproach
     And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
     I crave the benefit of law of arms.
VERNON
     And that is my petition, noble lord:
     For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
     To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
     Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;
     And he first took exceptions at this badge,
     Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
     Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
YORK
     Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?
SOMERSET
     Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
     Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
KING HENRY VI
     Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,
     When for so slight and frivolous a cause
     Such factious emulations shall arise!
     Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
     Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
YORK
     Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
     And then your highness shall command a peace.
SOMERSET
     The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
     Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
YORK
     There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.
VERNON
     Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
BASSET
     Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
GLOUCESTER
     Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
     And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
     Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed
     With this immodest clamorous outrage
     To trouble and disturb the king and us?
     And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
     To bear with their perverse objections;
     Much less to take occasion from their mouths
     To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
     Let me persuade you take a better course.
EXETER
     It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.
KING HENRY VI
     Come hither, you that would be combatants:
     Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
     Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
     And you, my lords, remember where we are,
     In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:
     If they perceive dissension in our looks
     And that within ourselves we disagree,
     How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
     To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
     Beside, what infamy will there arise,
     When foreign princes shall be certified
     That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
     King Henry's peers and chief nobility
     Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
     O, think upon the conquest of my father,
     My tender years, and let us not forego
     That for a trifle that was bought with blood
     Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
     I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
     Putting on a red rose
     That any one should therefore be suspicious
     I more incline to Somerset than York:
     Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:
     As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
     Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.
     But your discretions better can persuade
     Than I am able to instruct or teach:
     And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
     So let us still continue peace and love.
     Cousin of York, we institute your grace
     To be our regent in these parts of France:
     And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
     Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
     And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
     Go cheerfully together and digest.
     Your angry choler on your enemies.
     Ourself, my lord protector and the rest
     After some respite will return to Calais;
     From thence to England; where I hope ere long
     To be presented, by your victories,
     With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.
     Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER and VERNON
WARWICK
     My Lord of York, I promise you, the king
     Prettily, methought, did play the orator.
YORK
     And so he did; but yet I like it not,
     In that he wears the badge of Somerset.
WARWICK
     Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;
     I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
YORK
     An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;
     Other affairs must now be managed.
     Exeunt all but EXETER
EXETER
     Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
     For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,
     I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
     More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
     Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
     But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
     This jarring discord of nobility,
     This shouldering of each other in the court,
     This factious bandying of their favourites,
     But that it doth presage some ill event.
     'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
     But more when envy breeds unkind division;
     There comes the rain, there begins confusion.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Before Bourdeaux. ****
     Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum
TALBOT
     Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:
     Summon their general unto the wall.
     Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft
     English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
     Servant in arms to Harry King of England;
     And thus he would: Open your city gates;
     Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,
     And do him homage as obedient subjects;
     And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:
     But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,
     You tempt the fury of my three attendants,
     Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;
     Who in a moment even with the earth
     Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,
     If you forsake the offer of their love.
General
     Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,
     Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
     The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
     On us thou canst not enter but by death;
     For, I protest, we are well fortified
     And strong enough to issue out and fight:
     If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
     Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:
     On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,
     To wall thee from the liberty of flight;
     And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,
     But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
     And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
     Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
     To rive their dangerous artillery
     Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.
     Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,
     Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!
     This is the latest glory of thy praise
     That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;
     For ere the glass, that now begins to run,
     Finish the process of his sandy hour,
     These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,
     Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.
     Drum afar off
     Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,
     Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;
     And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.
     Exeunt General, & c
TALBOT
     He fables not; I hear the enemy:
     Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
     O, negligent and heedless discipline!
     How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,
     A little herd of England's timorous deer,
     Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
     If we be English deer, be then in blood;
     Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,
     But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
     Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
     And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:
     Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
     And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
     God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,
     Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Plains in Gascony. ****
     Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK with trumpet and many
     Soldiers
YORK
     Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,
     That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
Messenger
     They are return'd, my lord, and give it out
     That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,
     To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,
     By your espials were discovered
     Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
     Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.
YORK
     A plague upon that villain Somerset,
     That thus delays my promised supply
     Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
     Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,
     And I am lowted by a traitor villain
     And cannot help the noble chevalier:
     God comfort him in this necessity!
     If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.
     Enter Sir William LUCY
LUCY
     Thou princely leader of our English strength,
     Never so needful on the earth of France,
     Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,
     Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
     And hemm'd about with grim destruction:
     To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!
     Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.
YORK
     O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart
     Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
     So should we save a valiant gentleman
     By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
     Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
     That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.
LUCY
     O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!
YORK
     He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
     We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;
     All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.
LUCY
     Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;
     And on his son young John, who two hours since
     I met in travel toward his warlike father!
     This seven years did not Talbot see his son;
     And now they meet where both their lives are done.
YORK
     Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
     To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
     Away! vexation almost stops my breath,
     That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.
     Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
     But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
     Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,
     'Long all of Somerset and his delay.
     Exit, with his soldiers
LUCY
     Thus, while the vulture of sedition
     Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,
     Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
     The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,
     That ever living man of memory,
     Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
     Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.
     Exit
**** SCENE IV. Other plains in Gascony. ****
     Enter SOMERSET, with his army; a Captain of TALBOT's with him
SOMERSET
     It is too late; I cannot send them now:
     This expedition was by York and Talbot
     Too rashly plotted: all our general force
     Might with a sally of the very town
     Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
     Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
     By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:
     York set him on to fight and die in shame,
     That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.
Captain
     Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
     Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.
     Enter Sir William LUCY
SOMERSET
     How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?
LUCY
     Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;
     Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,
     Cries out for noble York and Somerset,
     To beat assailing death from his weak legions:
     And whiles the honourable captain there
     Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,
     And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,
     You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,
     Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
     Let not your private discord keep away
     The levied succors that should lend him aid,
     While he, renowned noble gentleman,
     Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
     Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,
     Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,
     And Talbot perisheth by your default.
SOMERSET
     York set him on; York should have sent him aid.
LUCY
     And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;
     Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
     Collected for this expedition.
SOMERSET
     York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;
     I owe him little duty, and less love;
     And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
LUCY
     The fraud of England, not the force of France,
     Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:
     Never to England shall he bear his life;
     But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.
SOMERSET
     Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:
     Within six hours they will be at his aid.
LUCY
     Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;
     For fly he could not, if he would have fled;
     And fly would Talbot never, though he might.
SOMERSET
     If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!
LUCY
     His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. The English camp near Bourdeaux. ****
     Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son
TALBOT
     O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
     To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
     That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
     When sapless age and weak unable limbs
     Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
     But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
     Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
     A terrible and unavoided danger:
     Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;
     And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
     By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.
JOHN TALBOT
     Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
     And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,
     Dishonour not her honourable name,
     To make a bastard and a slave of me!
     The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,
     That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
TALBOT
     Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
JOHN TALBOT
     He that flies so will ne'er return again.
TALBOT
     If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
JOHN TALBOT
     Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:
     Your loss is great, so your regard should be;
     My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
     Upon my death the French can little boast;
     In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
     Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;
     But mine it will, that no exploit have done:
     You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;
     But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
     There is no hope that ever I will stay,
     If the first hour I shrink and run away.
     Here on my knee I beg mortality,
     Rather than life preserved with infamy.
TALBOT
     Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
JOHN TALBOT
     Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
TALBOT
     Upon my blessing, I command thee go.
JOHN TALBOT
     To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.
TALBOT
     Part of thy father may be saved in thee.
JOHN TALBOT
     No part of him but will be shame in me.
TALBOT
     Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.
JOHN TALBOT
     Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?
TALBOT
     Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
JOHN TALBOT
     You cannot witness for me, being slain.
     If death be so apparent, then both fly.
TALBOT
     And leave my followers here to fight and die?
     My age was never tainted with such shame.
JOHN TALBOT
     And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
     No more can I be sever'd from your side,
     Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:
     Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;
     For live I will not, if my father die.
TALBOT
     Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
     Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
     Come, side by side together live and die.
     And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. A field of battle. ****
     Alarum: excursions, wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about, and TALBOT
     rescues him
TALBOT
     Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.
     The regent hath with Talbot broke his word
     And left us to the rage of France his sword.
     Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;
     I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
JOHN TALBOT
     O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
     The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,
     Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,
     To my determined time thou gavest new date.
TALBOT
     When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,
     It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
     Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
     Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
     Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,
     And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
     The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood
     From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
     Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,
     And interchanging blows I quickly shed
     Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace
     Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base
     And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
     Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
     Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'
     Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
     Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,
     Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?
     Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
     Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
     Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:
     The help of one stands me in little stead.
     O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
     To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
     If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
     To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
     By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
     'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:
     In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
     My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:
     All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
     All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.
JOHN TALBOT
     The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
     These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:
     On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
     To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
     Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
     The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
     And like me to the peasant boys of France,
     To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
     Surely, by all the glory you have won,
     An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:
     Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
     If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.
TALBOT
     Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,
     Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:
     If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;
     And, commendable proved, let's die in pride.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VII. Another part of the field. ****
     Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant
TALBOT
     Where is my other life? mine own is gone;
     O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
     Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
     Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:
     When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,
     His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
     And, like a hungry lion, did commence
     Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
     But when my angry guardant stood alone,
     Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,
     Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
     Suddenly made him from my side to start
     Into the clustering battle of the French;
     And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
     His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
     My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
Servant
     O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!
     Enter Soldiers, with the body of JOHN TALBOT
TALBOT
     Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
     Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
     Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
     Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
     In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
     O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,
     Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
     Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;
     Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
     Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
     Had death been French, then death had died to-day.
     Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:
     My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
     Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
     Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
     Dies
     Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BURGUNDY, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, JOAN LA
     PUCELLE, and forces
CHARLES
     Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
     We should have found a bloody day of this.
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,
     Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
     'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'
     But, with a proud majestical high scorn,
     He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
     To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'
     So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
     He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.
BURGUNDY
     Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
     See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms
     Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
BASTARD OF ORLEANS
     Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder
     Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.
CHARLES
     O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled
     During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
     Enter Sir William LUCY, attended; Herald of the French preceding
LUCY
     Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,
     To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.
CHARLES
     On what submissive message art thou sent?
LUCY
     Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;
     We English warriors wot not what it means.
     I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
     And to survey the bodies of the dead.
CHARLES
     For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.
     But tell me whom thou seek'st.
LUCY
     But where's the great Alcides of the field,
     Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
     Created, for his rare success in arms,
     Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;
     Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,
     Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,
     Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,
     The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;
     Knight of the noble order of Saint George,
     Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;
     Great marshal to Henry the Sixth
     Of all his wars within the realm of France?
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Here is a silly stately style indeed!
     The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
     Writes not so tedious a style as this.
     Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
     Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.
LUCY
     Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,
     Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?
     O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,
     That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!
     O, that I could but call these dead to life!
     It were enough to fright the realm of France:
     Were but his picture left amongst you here,
     It would amaze the proudest of you all.
     Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence
     And give them burial as beseems their worth.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
     He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
     For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,
     They would but stink, and putrefy the air.
CHARLES
     Go, take their bodies hence.
LUCY
     I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd
     A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
CHARLES
     So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.
     And now to Paris, in this conquering vein:
     All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain.
     Exeunt
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. London. The palace. ****
     Sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, and EXETER
KING HENRY VI
     Have you perused the letters from the pope,
     The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?
GLOUCESTER
     I have, my lord: and their intent is this:
     They humbly sue unto your excellence
     To have a godly peace concluded of
     Between the realms of England and of France.
KING HENRY VI
     How doth your grace affect their motion?
GLOUCESTER
     Well, my good lord; and as the only means
     To stop effusion of our Christian blood
     And 'stablish quietness on every side.
KING HENRY VI
     Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought
     It was both impious and unnatural
     That such immanity and bloody strife
     Should reign among professors of one faith.
GLOUCESTER
     Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect
     And surer bind this knot of amity,
     The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,
     A man of great authority in France,
     Proffers his only daughter to your grace
     In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.
KING HENRY VI
     Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!
     And fitter is my study and my books
     Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
     Yet call the ambassador; and, as you please,
     So let them have their answers every one:
     I shall be well content with any choice
     Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.
     Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER in Cardinal's habit, a Legate and two
     Ambassadors
EXETER
     What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,
     And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
     Then I perceive that will be verified
     Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,
     'If once he come to be a cardinal,
     He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'
KING HENRY VI
     My lords ambassadors, your several suits
     Have been consider'd and debated on.
     And therefore are we certainly resolved
     To draw conditions of a friendly peace;
     Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
     Shall be transported presently to France.
GLOUCESTER
     And for the proffer of my lord your master,
     I have inform'd his highness so at large
     As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,
     Her beauty and the value of her dower,
     He doth intend she shall be England's queen.
KING HENRY VI
     In argument and proof of which contract,
     Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.
     And so, my lord protector, see them guarded
     And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd
     Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
     Exeunt all but CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER and Legate
     CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER
     Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive
     The sum of money which I promised
     Should be deliver'd to his holiness
     For clothing me in these grave ornaments.
Legate
     I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.
     CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER
     [Aside] Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,
     Or be inferior to the proudest peer.
     Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive
     That, neither in birth or for authority,
     The bishop will be overborne by thee:
     I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,
     Or sack this country with a mutiny.

     LA PUCELLE, and forces
CHARLES
     These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits:
     'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
     And turn again unto the warlike French.
ALENCON
     Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
     And keep not back your powers in dalliance.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us;
     Else, ruin combat with their palaces!
     Enter Scout
Scout
     Success unto our valiant general,
     And happiness to his accomplices!
CHARLES
     What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak.
Scout
     The English army, that divided was
     Into two parties, is now conjoined in one,
     And means to give you battle presently.
CHARLES
     Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
     But we will presently provide for them.
BURGUNDY
     I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:
     Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
     Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
     Let Henry fret and all the world repine.
CHARLES
     Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!

JOAN LA PUCELLE
     The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.
     Now help, ye charming spells and periapts;
     And ye choice spirits that admonish me
     And give me signs of future accidents.
     Thunder
     You speedy helpers, that are substitutes
     Under the lordly monarch of the north,
     Appear and aid me in this enterprise.
     Enter Fiends
     This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
     Of your accustom'd diligence to me.
     Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd
     Out of the powerful regions under earth,
     Help me this once, that France may get the field.
     They walk, and speak not
     O, hold me not with silence over-long!
     Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,
     I'll lop a member off and give it you
     In earnest of further benefit,
     So you do condescend to help me now.
     They hang their heads
     No hope to have redress? My body shall
     Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
     They shake their heads
     Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
     Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
     Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,
     Before that England give the French the foil.
     They depart
     See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
     That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest
     And let her head fall into England's lap.
     My ancient incantations are too weak,
     And hell too strong for me to buckle with:
     Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.
     Exit
     Excursions. Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE fighting hand to hand with YORK.
     JOAN LA PUCELLE is taken. The French fly.
YORK
     Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
     Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
     And try if they can gain your liberty.
     A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
     See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,
     As if with Circe she would change my shape!
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
YORK
     O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;
     No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
     And may ye both be suddenly surprised
     By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!
YORK
     Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile.
YORK
     Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.
     Exeunt
     Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand
SUFFOLK
     Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
     Gazes on her
     O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!
     For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;
     I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,
     And lay them gently on thy tender side.
     Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.
MARGARET
     Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
     The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.
SUFFOLK
     An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.
     Be not offended, nature's miracle,
     Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:
     So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
     Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.
     Yet, if this servile usage once offend.
     Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.
     She is going
     O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;
     My hand would free her, but my heart says no
     As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
     Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
     So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
     Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:
     I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.
     Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;
     Hast not a tongue? is she not here?
     Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
     Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,
     Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
MARGARET
     Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--
     What ransom must I pay before I pass?
     For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
SUFFOLK
     How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,
     Before thou make a trial of her love?
MARGARET
     Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?
SUFFOLK
     She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;
     She is a woman, therefore to be won.
MARGARET
     Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.
SUFFOLK
     Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;
     Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
MARGARET
     I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.
SUFFOLK
     There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
MARGARET
     He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
SUFFOLK
     And yet a dispensation may be had.
MARGARET
     And yet I would that you would answer me.
SUFFOLK
     I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
     Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!
MARGARET
     He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
SUFFOLK
     Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
     And peace established between these realms
     But there remains a scruple in that too;
     For though her father be the King of Naples,
     Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
     And our nobility will scorn the match.
MARGARET
     Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
SUFFOLK
     It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.
     Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
     Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
MARGARET
     What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,
     And will not any way dishonour me.
SUFFOLK
     Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
MARGARET
     Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;
     And then I need not crave his courtesy.
SUFFOLK
     Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--
MARGARET
     Tush, women have been captivate ere now.
SUFFOLK
     Lady, wherefore talk you so?
MARGARET
     I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.
SUFFOLK
     Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
     Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
MARGARET
     To be a queen in bondage is more vile
     Than is a slave in base servility;
     For princes should be free.
SUFFOLK
     And so shall you,
     If happy England's royal king be free.
MARGARET
     Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
SUFFOLK
     I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
     To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
     And set a precious crown upon thy head,
     If thou wilt condescend to be my--
MARGARET
     What?
SUFFOLK
     His love.
MARGARET
     I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
SUFFOLK
     No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
     To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,
     And have no portion in the choice myself.
     How say you, madam, are ye so content?
MARGARET
     An if my father please, I am content.
SUFFOLK
     Then call our captains and our colours forth.
     And, madam, at your father's castle walls
     We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.
     A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls
     See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!
REIGNIER
     To whom?
SUFFOLK
     To me.
REIGNIER
     Suffolk, what remedy?
     I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
     Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
SU FFOLK
     Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:
     Consent, and for thy honour give consent,
     Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;
     Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
     And this her easy-held imprisonment
     Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
REIGNIER
     Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
SUFFOLK
     Fair Margaret knows
     That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.
REIGNIER
     Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
     To give thee answer of thy just demand.
     Exit from the walls
SUFFOLK
     And here I will expect thy coming.
     Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below
REIGNIER
     Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:
     Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
SUFFOLK
     Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
     Fit to be made companion with a king:
     What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
REIGNIER
     Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
     To be the princely bride of such a lord;
     Upon condition I may quietly
     Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,
     Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
     My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
SUFFOLK
     That is her ransom; I deliver her;
     And those two counties I will undertake
     Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
REIGNIER
     And I again, in Henry's royal name,
     As deputy unto that gracious king,
     Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.
SUFFOLK
     Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
     Because this is in traffic of a king.
     Aside
     And yet, methinks, I could be well content
     To be mine own attorney in this case.
     I'll over then to England with this news,
     And make this marriage to be solemnized.
     So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe
     In golden palaces, as it becomes.
REIGNIER
     I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
     The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.
MARGARET
     Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers
     Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
     Going
SUFFOLK
     Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;
     No princely commendations to my king?
MARGARET
     Such commendations as becomes a maid,
     A virgin and his servant, say to him.
SUFFOLK
     Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
     But madam, I must trouble you again;
     No loving token to his majesty?
MARGARET
     Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,
     Never yet taint with love, I send the king.
SUFFOLK
     And this withal.
     Kisses her
MARGARET
     That for thyself: I will not so presume
     To send such peevish tokens to a king.
     Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
SUFFOLK
     O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;
     Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;
     There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
     Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
     Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
     And natural graces that extinguish art;
     Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
     That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,
     Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
     Exit
**** SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou. ****
     Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others
YORK
     Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
     Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd
Shepherd
     Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
     Have I sought every country far and near,
     And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
     Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
     Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
     I am descended of a gentler blood:
     Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
Shepherd
     Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
     I did beget her, all the parish knows:
     Her mother liveth yet, can testify
     She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
WARWICK
     Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
YORK
     This argues what her kind of life hath been,
     Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
Shepherd
     Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
     God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
     And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:
     Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,
     Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
Shepherd
     'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
     The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
     Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
     Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
     Of thy nativity! I would the milk
     Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,
     Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
     Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
     I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
     Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
     O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
     Exit
YORK
     Take her away; for she hath lived too long,
     To fill the world with vicious qualities.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
     Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
     But issued from the progeny of kings;
     Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
     By inspiration of celestial grace,
     To work exceeding miracles on earth.
     I never had to do with wicked spirits:
     But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
     Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
     Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
     Because you want the grace that others have,
     You judge it straight a thing impossible
     To compass wonders but by help of devils.
     No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
     A virgin from her tender infancy,
     Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
     Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
     Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
YORK
     Ay, ay: away with her to execution!
WARWICK
     And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
     Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:
     Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
     That so her torture may be shortened.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
     Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,
     That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
     I am with child, ye bloody homicides:
     Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
     Although ye hale me to a violent death.
YORK
     Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!
WARWICK
     The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
     Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
YORK
     She and the Dauphin have been juggling:
     I did imagine what would be her refuge.
WARWICK
     Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;
     Especially since Charles must father it.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     You are deceived; my child is none of his:
     It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
YORK
     Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
     It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     O, give me leave, I have deluded you:
     'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,
     But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.
WARWICK
     A married man! that's most intolerable.
YORK
     Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,
     There were so many, whom she may accuse.
WARWICK
     It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
YORK
     And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
     Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:
     Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
JOAN LA PUCELLE
     Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
     May never glorious sun reflex his beams
     Upon the country where you make abode;
     But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
     Environ you, till mischief and despair
     Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
     Exit, guarded
YORK
     Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,
     Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
     Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended
     CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER
     Lord regent, I do greet your excellence
     With letters of commission from the king.
     For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
     Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
     Have earnestly implored a general peace
     Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
     And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
     Approacheth, to confer about some matter.
YORK
     Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
     After the slaughter of so many peers,
     So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,
     That in this quarrel have been overthrown
     And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
     Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
     Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
     By treason, falsehood and by treachery,
     Our great progenitors had conquered?
     O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
     The utter loss of all the realm of France.
WARWICK
     Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,
     It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
     As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
     Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others
CHARLES
     Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
     That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,
     We come to be informed by yourselves
     What the conditions of that league must be.
YORK
     Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
     The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
     By sight of these our baleful enemies.
     CARDINAL
OF WINCHESTER
     Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
     That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
     Of mere compassion and of lenity,
     To ease your country of distressful war,
     And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
     You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
     And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
     To pay him tribute, submit thyself,
     Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,
     And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
ALENCON
     Must he be then as shadow of himself?
     Adorn his temples with a coronet,
     And yet, in substance and authority,
     Retain but privilege of a private man?
     This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
CHARLES
     'Tis known already that I am possess'd
     With more than half the Gallian territories,
     And therein reverenced for their lawful king:
     Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
     Detract so much from that prerogative,
     As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
     No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
     That which I have than, coveting for more,
     Be cast from possibility of all.
YORK
     Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
     Used intercession to obtain a league,
     And, now the matter grows to compromise,
     Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
     Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
     Of benefit proceeding from our king
     And not of any challenge of desert,
     Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
REIGNIER
     My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
     To cavil in the course of this contract:
     If once it be neglected, ten to one
     We shall not find like opportunity.
ALENCON
     To say the truth, it is your policy
     To save your subjects from such massacre
     And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
     By our proceeding in hostility;
     And therefore take this compact of a truce,
     Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
WARWICK
     How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?
CHARLES
     It shall;
     Only reserved, you claim no interest
     In any of our towns of garrison.
YORK
     Then swear allegiance to his majesty,
     As thou art knight, never to disobey
     Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,
     Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
     So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
     Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,
     For here we entertain a solemn peace.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. London. The palace. ****
     Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER
KING HENRY VI
     Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
     Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
     Her virtues graced with external gifts
     Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
     And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
     Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
     So am I driven by breath of her renown
     Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
     Where I may have fruition of her love.
SUFFOLK
     Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
     Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
     The chief perfections of that lovely dame
     Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
     Would make a volume of enticing lines,
     Able to ravish any dull conceit:
     And, which is more, she is not so divine,
     So full-replete with choice of all delights,
     But with as humble lowliness of mind
     She is content to be at your command;
     Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
     To love and honour Henry as her lord.
KING HENRY VI
     And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
     Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
     That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
GLOUCESTER
     So should I give consent to flatter sin.
     You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
     Unto another lady of esteem:
     How shall we then dispense with that contract,
     And not deface your honour with reproach?
SUFFOLK
     As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
     Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
     To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
     By reason of his adversary's odds:
     A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
     And therefore may be broke without offence.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
     Her father is no better than an earl,
     Although in glorious titles he excel.
SUFFOLK
     Yes, lord, her father is a king,
     The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
     And of such great authority in France
     As his alliance will confirm our peace
     And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
GLOUCESTER
     And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
     Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
EXETER
     Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
     Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
SUFFOLK
     A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
     That he should be so abject, base and poor,
     To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
     Henry is able to enrich his queen
     And not seek a queen to make him rich:
     So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
     As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
     Marriage is a matter of more worth
     Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;
     Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
     Must be companion of his nuptial bed:
     And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
     It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
     In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
     For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
     An age of discord and continual strife?
     Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
     And is a pattern of celestial peace.
     Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
     But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
     Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
     Approves her fit for none but for a king:
     Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
     More than in women commonly is seen,
     Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
     For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
     Is likely to beget more conquerors,
     If with a lady of so high resolve
     As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
     Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
     That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
KING HENRY VI
     Whether it be through force of your report,
     My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
     My tender youth was never yet attaint
     With any passion of inflaming love,
     I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
     I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
     Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
     As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
     Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
     Agree to any covenants, and procure
     That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
     To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
     King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
     For your expenses and sufficient charge,
     Among the people gather up a tenth.
     Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,
     I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
     And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
     If you do censure me by what you were,
     Not what you are, I know it will excuse
     This sudden execution of my will.
     And so, conduct me where, from company,
     I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
     Exit
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
     Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
SUFFOLK
     Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,
     As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
     With hope to find the like event in love,
     But prosper better than the Trojan did.
     Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;
     But I will rule both her, the king and realm.
     Exit
