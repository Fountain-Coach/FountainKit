Pericles, Prince of Tyre
**** ACT I ****
**** PROLOGUE ****
     Enter GOWER
     Before the palace of Antioch
     To sing a song that old was sung,
     From ashes ancient Gower is come;
     Assuming man's infirmities,
     To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
     It hath been sung at festivals,
     On ember-eves and holy-ales;
     And lords and ladies in their lives
     Have read it for restoratives:
     The purchase is to make men glorious;
     Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
     If you, born in these latter times,
     When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.
     And that to hear an old man sing
     May to your wishes pleasure bring
     I life would wish, and that I might
     Waste it for you, like taper-light.
     This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
     Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
     The fairest in all Syria,
     I tell you what mine authors say:
     This king unto him took a fere,
     Who died and left a female heir,
     So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
     As heaven had lent her all his grace;
     With whom the father liking took,
     And her to incest did provoke:
     Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
     To evil should be done by none:
     But custom what they did begin
     Was with long use account no sin.
     The beauty of this sinful dame
     Made many princes thither frame,
     To seek her as a bed-fellow,
     In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
     Which to prevent he made a law,
     To keep her still, and men in awe,
     That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
     His riddle told not, lost his life:
     So for her many a wight did die,
     As yon grim looks do testify.
     What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
     I give, my cause who best can justify.
     Exit
**** SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace. ****
     Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers
ANTIOCHUS
     Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
     The danger of the task you undertake.
PERICLES
     I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
     Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
     Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
ANTIOCHUS
     Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
     For the embracements even of Jove himself;
     At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
     Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
     The senate-house of planets all did sit,
     To knit in her their best perfections.
     Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
PERICLES
     See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
     Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
     Of every virtue gives renown to men!
     Her face the book of praises, where is read
     Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
     Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
     Could never be her mild companion.
     You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
     That have inflamed desire in my breast
     To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
     Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
     As I am son and servant to your will,
     To compass such a boundless happiness!
ANTIOCHUS
     Prince Pericles,--
PERICLES
     That would be son to great Antiochus.
ANTIOCHUS
     Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
     With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
     For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
     Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
     Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
     And which, without desert, because thine eye
     Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
     Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
     Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
     Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
     That without covering, save yon field of stars,
     Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
     And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
     For going on death's net, whom none resist.
PERICLES
     Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
     My frail mortality to know itself,
     And by those fearful objects to prepare
     This body, like to them, to what I must;
     For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
     Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
     I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
     Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
     Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
     So I bequeath a happy peace to you
     And all good men, as every prince should do;
     My riches to the earth from whence they came;
     But my unspotted fire of love to you.
     To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
     Thus ready for the way of life or death,
     I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.
ANTIOCHUS
     Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
     Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
     As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
Daughter
     Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
     Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
PERICLES
     Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
     Nor ask advice of any other thought
     But faithfulness and courage.
     He reads the riddle
     I am no viper, yet I feed
     On mother's flesh which did me breed.
     I sought a husband, in which labour
     I found that kindness in a father:
     He's father, son, and husband mild;
     I mother, wife, and yet his child.
     How they may be, and yet in two,
     As you will live, resolve it you.
     Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
     That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
     Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
     If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
     Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
     Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
     Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
     But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
     For he's no man on whom perfections wait
     That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
     You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
     Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
     Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:
     But being play'd upon before your time,
     Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
     Good sooth, I care not for you.
ANTIOCHUS
     Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
     For that's an article within our law,
     As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
     Either expound now, or receive your sentence.
PERICLES
     Great king,
     Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
     'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
     Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
     He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
     For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
     Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;
     And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
     The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
     To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
     Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
     By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
     Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
     their will;
     And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
     It is enough you know; and it is fit,
     What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
     All love the womb that their first being bred,
     Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
ANTIOCHUS
     [Aside] Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
     the meaning:
     But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
     Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
     Your exposition misinterpreting,
     We might proceed to cancel of your days;
     Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
     As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
     Forty days longer we do respite you;
     If by which time our secret be undone,
     This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
     And until then your entertain shall be
     As doth befit our honour and your worth.
     Exeunt all but PERICLES
PERICLES
     How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
     When what is done is like an hypocrite,
     The which is good in nothing but in sight!
     If it be true that I interpret false,
     Then were it certain you were not so bad
     As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
     Where now you're both a father and a son,
     By your untimely claspings with your child,
     Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
     And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
     By the defiling of her parent's bed;
     And both like serpents are, who though they feed
     On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
     Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
     Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
     Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
     One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
     Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
     Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
     Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
     Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
     By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
     Exit
     Re-enter ANTIOCHUS
ANTIOCHUS
     He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
     To have his head.
     He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
     Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
     In such a loathed manner;
     And therefore instantly this prince must die:
     For by his fall my honour must keep high.
     Who attends us there?
     Enter THALIARD
THALIARD
     Doth your highness call?
ANTIOCHUS
     Thaliard,
     You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
     Her private actions to your secrecy;
     And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
     Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
     We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
     It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
     Because we bid it. Say, is it done?
THALIARD
     My lord,
     'Tis done.
ANTIOCHUS
     Enough.
     Enter a Messenger
     Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
Messenger
     My lord, prince Pericles is fled.
     Exit
ANTIOCHUS
     As thou
     Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
     From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
     His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
     Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'
THALIARD
     My lord,
     If I can get him within my pistol's length,
     I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.
ANTIOCHUS
     Thaliard, adieu!
     Exit THALIARD
     Till Pericles be dead,
     My heart can lend no succor to my head.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace. ****
     Enter PERICLES
PERICLES
     [To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why should
     this change of thoughts,
     The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
     Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
     In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
     The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
     Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
     And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
     Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
     Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
     Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
     Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
     That have their first conception by mis-dread,
     Have after-nourishment and life by care;
     And what was first but fear what might be done,
     Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
     And so with me: the great Antiochus,
     'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
     Since he's so great can make his will his act,
     Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
     Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
     If he suspect I may dishonour him:
     And what may make him blush in being known,
     He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
     With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
     And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
     Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
     Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
     And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
     Which care of them, not pity of myself,
     Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
     Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
     Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
     And punish that before that he would punish.
     Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords
First Lord
     Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
Second Lord
     And keep your mind, till you return to us,
     Peaceful and comfortable!
HELICANUS
     Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
     They do abuse the king that flatter him:
     For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
     The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
     To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
     Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
     Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
     When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
     He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
     Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
     I cannot be much lower than my knees.
PERICLES
     All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
     What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
     And then return to us.
     Exeunt Lords
     Helicanus, thou
     Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
HELICANUS
     An angry brow, dread lord.
PERICLES
     If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
     How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?
HELICANUS
     How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
     They have their nourishment?
PERICLES
     Thou know'st I have power
     To take thy life from thee.
HELICANUS
     [Kneeling]
     I have ground the axe myself;
     Do you but strike the blow.
PERICLES
     Rise, prithee, rise.
     Sit down: thou art no flatterer:
     I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
     That kings should let their ears hear their
     faults hid!
     Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
     Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
     What wouldst thou have me do?
HELICANUS
     To bear with patience
     Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
PERICLES
     Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
     That minister'st a potion unto me
     That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
     Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
     Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
     I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
     From whence an issue I might propagate,
     Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
     Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
     The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
     Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
     Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
     know'st this,
     'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
     Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
     Under the covering of a careful night,
     Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
     Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
     I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
     Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
     And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
     That I should open to the listening air
     How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
     To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
     To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
     And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
     When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
     Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
     Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
     Who now reprovest me for it,--
HELICANUS
     Alas, sir!
PERICLES
     Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
     Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
     How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
     And finding little comfort to relieve them,
     I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
HELICANUS
     Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
     Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
     And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
     Who either by public war or private treason
     Will take away your life.
     Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
     Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
     Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
     Your rule direct to any; if to me.
     Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
PERICLES
     I do not doubt thy faith;
     But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
HELICANUS
     We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
     From whence we had our being and our birth.
PERICLES
     Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
     Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;
     And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
     The care I had and have of subjects' good
     On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
     I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
     Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:
     But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
     That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
     Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace. ****
     Enter THALIARD
THALIARD
     So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I
     kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to
     be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive
     he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,
     being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired
     he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
     had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a
     villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
     be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.
     Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre
HELICANUS
     You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
     Further to question me of your king's departure:
     His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
     Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.
THALIARD
     [Aside] How! the king gone!
HELICANUS
     If further yet you will be satisfied,
     Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
     He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
     Being at Antioch--
THALIARD
     [Aside] What from Antioch?
HELICANUS
     Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--
     Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
     And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
     To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
     So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
     With whom each minute threatens life or death.
THALIARD
     [Aside] Well, I perceive
     I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
     But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:
     He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
     I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!
HELICANUS
     Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
THALIARD
     From him I come
     With message unto princely Pericles;
     But since my landing I have understood
     Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
     My message must return from whence it came.
HELICANUS
     We have no reason to desire it,
     Commended to our master, not to us:
     Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
     As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house. ****
     Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others
CLEON
     My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
     And by relating tales of others' griefs,
     See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
DIONYZA
     That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
     For who digs hills because they do aspire
     Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
     O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
     Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
     But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
CLEON
     O Dionyza,
     Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
     Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
     Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
     Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
     Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
     That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
     They may awake their helps to comfort them.
     I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
     And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
DIONYZA
     I'll do my best, sir.
CLEON
     This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
     A city on whom plenty held full hand,
     For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
     Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
     And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
     Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
     Like one another's glass to trim them by:
     Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
     And not so much to feed on as delight;
     All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
     The name of help grew odious to repeat.
DIONYZA
     O, 'tis too true.
CLEON
     But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
     These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
     Were all too little to content and please,
     Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
     As houses are defiled for want of use,
     They are now starved for want of exercise:
     Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
     Must have inventions to delight the taste,
     Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
     Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
     Thought nought too curious, are ready now
     To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
     So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
     Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
     Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
     Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
     Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
     Is not this true?
DIONYZA
     Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
CLEON
     O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
     And her prosperities so largely taste,
     With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
     The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
     Enter a Lord
Lord
     Where's the lord governor?
CLEON
     Here.
     Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
     For comfort is too far for us to expect.
Lord
     We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,
     A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
CLEON
     I thought as much.
     One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
     That may succeed as his inheritor;
     And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
     Taking advantage of our misery,
     Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
     To beat us down, the which are down already;
     And make a conquest of unhappy me,
     Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
Lord
     That's the least fear; for, by the semblance
     Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
     And come to us as favourers, not as foes.
CLEON
     Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
     Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
     But bring they what they will and what they can,
     What need we fear?
     The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
     Go tell their general we attend him here,
     To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
     And what he craves.
Lord
     I go, my lord.
     Exit
CLEON
     Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
     If wars, we are unable to resist.
     Enter PERICLES with Attendants
PERICLES
     Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
     Let not our ships and number of our men
     Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
     We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
     And seen the desolation of your streets:
     Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
     But to relieve them of their heavy load;
     And these our ships, you happily may think
     Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
     With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
     Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
     And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.
All
     The gods of Greece protect you!
     And we'll pray for you.
PERICLES
     Arise, I pray you, rise:
     We do not look for reverence, but to love,
     And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.
CLEON
     The which when any shall not gratify,
     Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
     Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
     The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
     Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
     Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
PERICLES
     Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
     Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
     Enter GOWER
GOWER
     Here have you seen a mighty king
     His child, I wis, to incest bring;
     A better prince and benign lord,
     That will prove awful both in deed and word.
     Be quiet then as men should be,
     Till he hath pass'd necessity.
     I'll show you those in troubles reign,
     Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
     The good in conversation,
     To whom I give my benison,
     Is still at Tarsus, where each man
     Thinks all is writ he speken can;
     And, to remember what he does,
     Build his statue to make him glorious:
     But tidings to the contrary
     Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?
     DUMB SHOW.
     Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all the train with
     them. Enter at another door a Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES;
     PERICLES shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a reward, and
     knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another
     Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,
     Not to eat honey like a drone
     From others' labours; for though he strive
     To killen bad, keep good alive;
     And to fulfil his prince' desire,
     Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
     How Thaliard came full bent with sin
     And had intent to murder him;
     And that in Tarsus was not best
     Longer for him to make his rest.
     He, doing so, put forth to seas,
     Where when men been, there's seldom ease;
     For now the wind begins to blow;
     Thunder above and deeps below
     Make such unquiet, that the ship
     Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;
     And he, good prince, having all lost,
     By waves from coast to coast is tost:
     All perishen of man, of pelf,
     Ne aught escapen but himself;
     Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
     Threw him ashore, to give him glad:
     And here he comes. What shall be next,
     Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.
     Exit
**** SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side. ****
     Enter PERICLES, wet
PERICLES
     Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
     Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man
     Is but a substance that must yield to you;
     And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:
     Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
     Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
     Nothing to think on but ensuing death:
     Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
     To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
     And having thrown him from your watery grave,
     Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
     Enter three FISHERMEN
First Fisherman
     What, ho, Pilch!
Second Fisherman
     Ha, come and bring away the nets!
First Fisherman
     What, Patch-breech, I say!
Third Fisherman
     What say you, master?
First Fisherman
     Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll
     fetch thee with a wanion.
Third Fisherman
     Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that
     were cast away before us even now.
First Fisherman
     Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
     pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,
     well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
Third Fisherman
     Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the
     porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say
     they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,
     they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I
     marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
First Fisherman
     Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the
     little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
     nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and
     tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
     last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
     have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping
     till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,
     steeple, bells, and all.
PERICLES
     [Aside] A pretty moral.
Third Fisherman
     But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have
     been that day in the belfry.
Second Fisherman
     Why, man?
Third Fisherman
     Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I
     had been in his belly, I would have kept such a
     jangling of the bells, that he should never have
     left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and
     parish up again. But if the good King Simonides
     were of my mind,--
PERICLES
     [Aside] Simonides!
Third Fisherman
     We would purge the land of these drones, that rob
     the bee of her honey.
PERICLES
     [Aside] How from the finny subject of the sea
     These fishers tell the infirmities of men;
     And from their watery empire recollect
     All that may men approve or men detect!
     Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.
Second Fisherman
     Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day
     fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody
     look after it.
PERICLES
     May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.
Second Fisherman
     What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
     way!
PERICLES
     A man whom both the waters and the wind,
     In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
     For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:
     He asks of you, that never used to beg.
First Fisherman
     No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our
     country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
     with working.
Second Fisherman
     Canst thou catch any fishes, then?
PERICLES
     I never practised it.
Second Fisherman
     Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothing
     to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.
PERICLES
     What I have been I have forgot to know;
     But what I am, want teaches me to think on:
     A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,
     And have no more of life than may suffice
     To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;
     Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
     For that I am a man, pray see me buried.
First Fisherman
     Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;
     come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a
     handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and
     we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for
     fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,
     and thou shalt be welcome.
PERICLES
     I thank you, sir.
Second Fisherman
     Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.
PERICLES
     I did but crave.
Second Fisherman
     But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I
     shall 'scape whipping.
PERICLES
     Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?
Second Fisherman
     O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your
     beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office
     than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the
     net.
     Exit with Third Fisherman
PERICLES
     [Aside] How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!
First Fisherman
     Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?
PERICLES
     Not well.
First Fisherman
     Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and
     our king the good Simonides.
PERICLES
     The good King Simonides, do you call him.
First Fisherman
     Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his
     peaceable reign and good government.
PERICLES
     He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects
     the name of good by his government. How far is his
     court distant from this shore?
First Fisherman
     Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell
     you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her
     birth-day; and there are princes and knights come
     from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.
PERICLES
     Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish
     to make one there.
First Fisherman
     O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man
     cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.
     Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net
Second Fisherman
     Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,
     like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardly
     come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and
     'tis turned to a rusty armour.
PERICLES
     An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.
     Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,
     Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
     And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
     Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
     With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
     'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
     Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--
     'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--
     The which the gods protect thee from!--may
     defend thee.'
     It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;
     Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
     Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:
     I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
     Since I have here my father's gift in's will.
First Fisherman
     What mean you, sir?
PERICLES
     To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
     For it was sometime target to a king;
     I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
     And for his sake I wish the having of it;
     And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,
     Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
     And if that ever my low fortune's better,
     I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.
First Fisherman
     Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?
PERICLES
     I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.
First Fisherman
     Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!
Second Fisherman
     Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up
     this garment through the rough seams of the waters:
     there are certain condolements, certain vails. I
     hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
     whence you had it.
PERICLES
     Believe 't, I will.
     By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
     And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
     This jewel holds his building on my arm:
     Unto thy value I will mount myself
     Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
     Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
     Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
     Of a pair of bases.
Second Fisherman
     We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
     make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.
PERICLES
     Then honour be but a goal to my will,
     This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the ****
     lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the
     reception of King, Princess, Lords, & c.
     Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants
SIMONIDES
     Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
First Lord
     They are, my liege;
     And stay your coming to present themselves.
SIMONIDES
     Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,
     In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
     Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
     For men to see, and seeing wonder at.
     Exit a Lord
THAISA
     It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
     My commendations great, whose merit's less.
SIMONIDES
     It's fit it should be so; for princes are
     A model which heaven makes like to itself:
     As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
     So princes their renowns if not respected.
     'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
     The labour of each knight in his device.
THAISA
     Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
     Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to
     the Princess
SIMONIDES
     Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
THAISA
     A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
     And the device he bears upon his shield
     Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
     The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'
SIMONIDES
     He loves you well that holds his life of you.
     The Second Knight passes over
     Who is the second that presents himself?
THAISA
     A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
     And the device he bears upon his shield
     Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
     The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
     The Third Knight passes over
SIMONIDES
     And what's the third?
THAISA
     The third of Antioch;
     And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
     The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'
     The Fourth Knight passes over
SIMONIDES
     What is the fourth?
THAISA
     A burning torch that's turned upside down;
     The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'
SIMONIDES
     Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
     Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
     The Fifth Knight passes over
THAISA
     The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
     Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
     The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
     The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over
SIMONIDES
     And what's
     The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
     With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
THAISA
     He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
     A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
     The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'
SIMONIDES
     A pretty moral;
     From the dejected state wherein he is,
     He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.
First Lord
     He had need mean better than his outward show
     Can any way speak in his just commend;
     For by his rusty outside he appears
     To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.
Second Lord
     He well may be a stranger, for he comes
     To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
Third Lord
     And on set purpose let his armour rust
     Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
SIMONIDES
     Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
     The outward habit by the inward man.
     But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw
     Into the gallery.
     Exeunt
     Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'
**** SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared. ****
     Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting
SIMONIDES
     Knights,
     To say you're welcome were superfluous.
     To place upon the volume of your deeds,
     As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
     Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
     Since every worth in show commends itself.
     Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
     You are princes and my guests.
THAISA
     But you, my knight and guest;
     To whom this wreath of victory I give,
     And crown you king of this day's happiness.
PERICLES
     'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.
SIMONIDES
     Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
     And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
     In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
     To make some good, but others to exceed;
     And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'
     the feast,--
     For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:
     Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.
KNIGHTS
     We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
SIMONIDES
     Your presence glads our days: honour we love;
     For who hates honour hates the gods above.
Marshal
     Sir, yonder is your place.
PERICLES
     Some other is more fit.
First Knight
     Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen
     That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
     Envy the great nor do the low despise.
PERICLES
     You are right courteous knights.
SIMONIDES
     Sit, sir, sit.
PERICLES
     By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
     These cates resist me, she but thought upon.
THAISA
     By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
     All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
     Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.
SIMONIDES
     He's but a country gentleman;
     Has done no more than other knights have done;
     Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.
THAISA
     To me he seems like diamond to glass.
PERICLES
     Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
     Which tells me in that glory once he was;
     Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
     And he the sun, for them to reverence;
     None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
     Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
     Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,
     The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:
     Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,
     He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
     And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
SIMONIDES
     What, are you merry, knights?
Knights
     Who can be other in this royal presence?
SIMONIDES
     Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
     As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
     We drink this health to you.
KNIGHTS
     We thank your grace.
SIMONIDES
     Yet pause awhile:
     Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
     As if the entertainment in our court
     Had not a show might countervail his worth.
     Note it not you, Thaisa?
THAISA
     What is it
     To me, my father?
SIMONIDES
     O, attend, my daughter:
     Princes in this should live like gods above,
     Who freely give to every one that comes
     To honour them:
     And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,
     Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
     Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
     Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.
THAISA
     Alas, my father, it befits not me
     Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
     He may my proffer take for an offence,
     Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
SIMONIDES
     How!
     Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
THAISA
     [Aside] Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
SIMONIDES
     And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
     Of whence he is, his name and parentage.
THAISA
     The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.
PERICLES
     I thank him.
THAISA
     Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
PERICLES
     I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
THAISA
     And further he desires to know of you,
     Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
PERICLES
     A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;
     My education been in arts and arms;
     Who, looking for adventures in the world,
     Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
     And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.
THAISA
     He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
     A gentleman of Tyre,
     Who only by misfortune of the seas
     Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
SIMONIDES
     Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
     And will awake him from his melancholy.
     Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
     And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
     Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
     Will very well become a soldier's dance.
     I will not have excuse, with saying this
     Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
     Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
     The Knights dance
     So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
     Come, sir;
     Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
     And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
     Are excellent in making ladies trip;
     And that their measures are as excellent.
PERICLES
     In those that practise them they are, my lord.
SIMONIDES
     O, that's as much as you would be denied
     Of your fair courtesy.
     The Knights and Ladies dance
     Unclasp, unclasp:
     Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.
     To PERICLES
     But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
     These knights unto their several lodgings!
     To PERICLES
     Yours, sir,
     We have given order to be next our own.
PERICLES
     I am at your grace's pleasure.
SIMONIDES
     Princes, it is too late to talk of love;
     And that's the mark I know you level at:
     Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
     To-morrow all for speeding do their best.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor's house. ****
     Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES
HELICANUS
     No, Escanes, know this of me,
     Antiochus from incest lived not free:
     For which, the most high gods not minding longer
     To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
     Due to this heinous capital offence,
     Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
     When he was seated in a chariot
     Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
     A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
     Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
     That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
     Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
ESCANES
     'Twas very strange.
HELICANUS
     And yet but justice; for though
     This king were great, his greatness was no guard
     To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.
ESCANES
     'Tis very true.
     Enter two or three Lords
First Lord
     See, not a man in private conference
     Or council has respect with him but he.
Second Lord
     It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
Third Lord
     And cursed be he that will not second it.
First Lord
     Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
HELICANUS
     With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.
First Lord
     Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
     And now at length they overflow their banks.
HELICANUS
     Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
First Lord
     Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;
     But if the prince do live, let us salute him,
     Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
     If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;
     If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;
     And be resolved he lives to govern us,
     Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,
     And leave us to our free election.
Second Lord
     Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:
     And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--
     Like goodly buildings left without a roof
     Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,
     That best know how to rule and how to reign,
     We thus submit unto,--our sovereign.
All
     Live, noble Helicane!
HELICANUS
     For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:
     If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
     Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
     Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
     A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to
     Forbear the absence of your king:
     If in which time expired, he not return,
     I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
     But if I cannot win you to this love,
     Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
     And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
     Whom if you find, and win unto return,
     You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
First Lord
     To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
     And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
     We with our travels will endeavour us.
HELICANUS
     Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
     When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace. ****
     Enter SIMONIDES, reading a letter, at one door: the Knights meet him
First Knight
     Good morrow to the good Simonides.
SIMONIDES
     Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
     That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
     A married life.
     Her reason to herself is only known,
     Which yet from her by no means can I get.
Second Knight
     May we not get access to her, my lord?
SIMONIDES
     'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied
     Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
     One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;
     This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
     And on her virgin honour will not break it.
Third Knight
     Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.
     Exeunt Knights
SIMONIDES
     So,
     They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:
     She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,
     Or never more to view nor day nor light.
     'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;
     I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,
     Not minding whether I dislike or no!
     Well, I do commend her choice;
     And will no longer have it be delay'd.
     Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
     Enter PERICLES
PERICLES
     All fortune to the good Simonides!
SIMONIDES
     To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you
     For your sweet music this last night: I do
     Protest my ears were never better fed
     With such delightful pleasing harmony.
PERICLES
     It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
     Not my desert.
SIMONIDES
     Sir, you are music's master.
PERICLES
     The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.
SIMONIDES
     Let me ask you one thing:
     What do you think of my daughter, sir?
PERICLES
     A most virtuous princess.
SIMONIDES
     And she is fair too, is she not?
PERICLES
     As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.
SIMONIDES
     Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;
     Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
     And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.
PERICLES
     I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
SIMONIDES
     She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.
PERICLES
     [Aside] What's here?
     A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
     'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
     O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
     A stranger and distressed gentleman,
     That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,
     But bent all offices to honour her.
SIMONIDES
     Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
     A villain.
PERICLES
     By the gods, I have not:
     Never did thought of mine levy offence;
     Nor never did my actions yet commence
     A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
SIMONIDES
     Traitor, thou liest.
PERICLES
     Traitor!
SIMONIDES
     Ay, traitor.
PERICLES
     Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
     That calls me traitor, I return the lie.
SIMONIDES
     [Aside] Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.
PERICLES
     My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
     That never relish'd of a base descent.
     I came unto your court for honour's cause,
     And not to be a rebel to her state;
     And he that otherwise accounts of me,
     This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.
SIMONIDES
     No?
     Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
     Enter THAISA
PERICLES
     Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
     Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
     Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
     To any syllable that made love to you.
THAISA
     Why, sir, say if you had,
     Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
SIMONIDES
     Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
     Aside
     I am glad on't with all my heart.--
     I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
     Will you, not having my consent,
     Bestow your love and your affections
     Upon a stranger?
     Aside
     who, for aught I know,
     May be, nor can I think the contrary,
     As great in blood as I myself.--
     Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame
     Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,
     Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--
     Man and wife:
     Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:
     And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;
     And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--
     What, are you both pleased?
THAISA
     Yes, if you love me, sir.
PERICLES
     Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.
SIMONIDES
     What, are you both agreed?
BOTH
     Yes, if it please your majesty.
SIMONIDES
     It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;
     And then with what haste you can get you to bed.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
     Enter GOWER
GOWER
     Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;
     No din but snores the house about,
     Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
     Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
     The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
     Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;
     And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
     E'er the blither for their drouth.
     Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.
     Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
     A babe is moulded. Be attent,
     And time that is so briefly spent
     With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
     What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
     DUMB SHOW.
     Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with Attendants; a
     Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES
     shows it SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter THAISA with
     child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The KING shows her the letter; she
     rejoices: she and PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with
     LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest
     By many a dern and painful perch
     Of Pericles the careful search,
     By the four opposing coigns
     Which the world together joins,
     Is made with all due diligence
     That horse and sail and high expense
     Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
     Fame answering the most strange inquire,
     To the court of King Simonides
     Are letters brought, the tenor these:
     Antiochus and his daughter dead;
     The men of Tyrus on the head
     Of Helicanus would set on
     The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
     The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
     Says to 'em, if King Pericles
     Come not home in twice six moons,
     He, obedient to their dooms,
     Will take the crown. The sum of this,
     Brought hither to Pentapolis,
     Y-ravished the regions round,
     And every one with claps can sound,
     'Our heir-apparent is a king!
     Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
     Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
     His queen with child makes her desire--
     Which who shall cross?--along to go:
     Omit we all their dole and woe:
     Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
     And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
     On Neptune's billow; half the flood
     Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
     Varies again; the grisly north
     Disgorges such a tempest forth,
     That, as a duck for life that dives,
     So up and down the poor ship drives:
     The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
     Does fall in travail with her fear:
     And what ensues in this fell storm
     Shall for itself itself perform.
     I nill relate, action may
     Conveniently the rest convey;
     Which might not what by me is told.
     In your imagination hold
     This stage the ship, upon whose deck
     The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.
     Exit
     SCENE I:
     Enter PERICLES, on shipboard
PERICLES
     Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
     Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast
     Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
     Having call'd them from the deep! O, still
     Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench
     Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,
     How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;
     Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle
     Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
     Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O
     Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
     To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
     Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs
     Of my queen's travails!
     Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant
     Now, Lychorida!
LYCHORIDA
     Here is a thing too young for such a place,
     Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
     Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
     Of your dead queen.
PERICLES
     How, how, Lychorida!
LYCHORIDA
     Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
     Here's all that is left living of your queen,
     A little daughter: for the sake of it,
     Be manly, and take comfort.
PERICLES
     O you gods!
     Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,
     And snatch them straight away? We here below
     Recall not what we give, and therein may
     Use honour with you.
LYCHORIDA
     Patience, good sir,
     Even for this charge.
PERICLES
     Now, mild may be thy life!
     For a more blustrous birth had never babe:
     Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
     Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
     That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!
     Thou hast as chiding a nativity
     As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,
     To herald thee from the womb: even at the first
     Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
     With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods
     Throw their best eyes upon't!
     Enter two Sailors
First Sailor
     What courage, sir? God save you!
PERICLES
     Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
     It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love
     Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,
     I would it would be quiet.
First Sailor
     Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
     Blow, and split thyself.
Second Sailor
     But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
     the moon, I care not.
First Sailor
     Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,
     the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be
     cleared of the dead.
PERICLES
     That's your superstition.
First Sailor
     Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still
     observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
     briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.
PERICLES
     As you think meet. Most wretched queen!
LYCHORIDA
     Here she lies, sir.
PERICLES
     A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;
     No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
     Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time
     To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
     Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
     Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
     And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
     And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
     Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,
     Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
     My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
     Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
     Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
     A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.
     Exit LYCHORIDA
Second Sailor
     Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked
     and bitumed ready.
PERICLES
     I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?
Second Sailor
     We are near Tarsus.
PERICLES
     Thither, gentle mariner.
     Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?
Second Sailor
     By break of day, if the wind cease.
PERICLES
     O, make for Tarsus!
     There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
     Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
     At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:
     I'll bring the body presently.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house. ****
     Enter CERIMON, with a Servant, and some Persons who have been
     shipwrecked
CERIMON
     Philemon, ho!
     Enter PHILEMON
PHILEMON
     Doth my lord call?
CERIMON
     Get fire and meat for these poor men:
     'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
Servant
     I have been in many; but such a night as this,
     Till now, I ne'er endured.
CERIMON
     Your master will be dead ere you return;
     There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
     That can recover him.
     To PHILEMON
     Give this to the 'pothecary,
     And tell me how it works.
     Exeunt all but CERIMON
     Enter two Gentlemen
First Gentleman
     Good morrow.
Second Gentleman
     Good morrow to your lordship.
CERIMON
     Gentlemen,
     Why do you stir so early?
First Gentleman
     Sir,
     Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
     Shook as the earth did quake;
     The very principals did seem to rend,
     And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear
     Made me to quit the house.
Second Gentleman
     That is the cause we trouble you so early;
     'Tis not our husbandry.
CERIMON
     O, you say well.
First Gentleman
     But I much marvel that your lordship, having
     Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
     Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
     'Tis most strange,
     Nature should be so conversant with pain,
     Being thereto not compell'd.
CERIMON
     I hold it ever,
     Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
     Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
     May the two latter darken and expend;
     But immortality attends the former.
     Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
     Have studied physic, through which secret art,
     By turning o'er authorities, I have,
     Together with my practise, made familiar
     To me and to my aid the blest infusions
     That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
     And I can speak of the disturbances
     That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
     A more content in course of true delight
     Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
     Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
     To please the fool and death.
Second Gentleman
     Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
     Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
     Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
     And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
     Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
     Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
     Enter two or three Servants with a chest
First Servant
     So; lift there.
CERIMON
     What is that?
First Servant
     Sir, even now
     Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:
     'Tis of some wreck.
CERIMON
     Set 't down, let's look upon't.
Second Gentleman
     'Tis like a coffin, sir.
CERIMON
     Whate'er it be,
     'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:
     If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
     'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.
Second Gentleman
     'Tis so, my lord.
CERIMON
     How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
     Did the sea cast it up?
First Servant
     I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
     As toss'd it upon shore.
CERIMON
     Wrench it open;
     Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.
Second Gentleman
     A delicate odour.
CERIMON
     As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
     O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
First Gentleman
     Most strange!
CERIMON
     Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
     With full bags of spices! A passport too!
     Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
     Reads from a scroll
     'Here I give to understand,
     If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
     I, King Pericles, have lost
     This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
     Who finds her, give her burying;
     She was the daughter of a king:
     Besides this treasure for a fee,
     The gods requite his charity!'
     If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
     That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.
Second Gentleman
     Most likely, sir.
CERIMON
     Nay, certainly to-night;
     For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
     That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:
     Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
     Exit a Servant
     Death may usurp on nature many hours,
     And yet the fire of life kindle again
     The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
     That had nine hours lien dead,
     Who was by good appliance recovered.
     Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire
     Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.
     The rough and woeful music that we have,
     Cause it to sound, beseech you.
     The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
     The music there!--I pray you, give her air.
     Gentlemen.
     This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth
     Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
     Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
     Into life's flower again!
First Gentleman
     The heavens,
     Through you, increase our wonder and set up
     Your fame forever.
CERIMON
     She is alive; behold,
     Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
     Which Pericles hath lost,
     Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
     The diamonds of a most praised water
     Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
     And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
     Rare as you seem to be.
     She moves
THAISA
     O dear Diana,
     Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?
Second Gentleman
     Is not this strange?
First Gentleman
     Most rare.
CERIMON
     Hush, my gentle neighbours!
     Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
     Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,
     For her relapse is mortal. Come, come;
     And AEsculapius guide us!
     Exeunt, carrying her away
**** SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house. ****
     Enter PERICLES, CLEON, DIONYZA, and LYCHORIDA with MARINA in her arms
PERICLES
     Most honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone;
     My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
     In a litigious peace. You, and your lady,
     Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods
     Make up the rest upon you!
CLEON
     Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,
     Yet glance full wanderingly on us.
DIONYZA
     O your sweet queen!
     That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,
     To have bless'd mine eyes with her!
PERICLES
     We cannot but obey
     The powers above us. Could I rage and roar
     As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
     Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,
     For she was born at sea, I have named so, here
     I charge your charity withal, leaving her
     The infant of your care; beseeching you
     To give her princely training, that she may be
     Manner'd as she is born.
CLEON
     Fear not, my lord, but think
     Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
     For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
     Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
     Should therein make me vile, the common body,
     By you relieved, would force me to my duty:
     But if to that my nature need a spur,
     The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
     To the end of generation!
PERICLES
     I believe you;
     Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,
     Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
     By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
     Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,
     Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.
     Good madam, make me blessed in your care
     In bringing up my child.
DIONYZA
     I have one myself,
     Who shall not be more dear to my respect
     Than yours, my lord.
PERICLES
     Madam, my thanks and prayers.
CLEON
     We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
     Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
     The gentlest winds of heaven.
PERICLES
     I will embrace
     Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,
     Lychorida, no tears:
     Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
     You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.

**** SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house. ****

CERIMON
     Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
     Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
     At your command. Know you the character?
THAISA
     It is my lord's.
     That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
     Even on my eaning time; but whether there
     Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
     I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
     My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
     A vestal livery will I take me to,
     And never more have joy.
CERIMON
     Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
     Diana's temple is not distant far,
     Where you may abide till your date expire.
     Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
     Shall there attend you.
THAISA
     My recompense is thanks, that's all;
     Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.

**** ACT IV ****
     Enter GOWER
GOWER
     Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
     Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
     His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
     Unto Diana there a votaress.
     Now to Marina bend your mind,
     Whom our fast-growing scene must find
     At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
     In music, letters; who hath gain'd
     Of education all the grace,
     Which makes her both the heart and place
     Of general wonder. But, alack,
     That monster envy, oft the wrack
     Of earned praise, Marina's life
     Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
     And in this kind hath our Cleon
     One daughter, and a wench full grown,
     Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
     Hight Philoten: and it is said
     For certain in our story, she
     Would ever with Marina be:
     Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
     With fingers long, small, white as milk;
     Or when she would with sharp needle wound
     The cambric, which she made more sound
     By hurting it; or when to the lute
     She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
     That still records with moan; or when
     She would with rich and constant pen
     Vail to her mistress Dian; still
     This Philoten contends in skill
     With absolute Marina: so
     With the dove of Paphos might the crow
     Vie feathers white. Marina gets
     All praises, which are paid as debts,
     And not as given. This so darks
     In Philoten all graceful marks,
     That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
     A present murderer does prepare
     For good Marina, that her daughter
     Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
     The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
     Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
     And cursed Dionyza hath
     The pregnant instrument of wrath
     Prest for this blow. The unborn event
     I do commend to your content:
     Only I carry winged time
     Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
     Which never could I so convey,
     Unless your thoughts went on my way.
     Dionyza does appear,
     With Leonine, a murderer.
     Exit
**** SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore. ****
     Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE
DIONYZA
     Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
     'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
     Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
     To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
     Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
     Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
     Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
     A soldier to thy purpose.
LEONINE
     I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
DIONYZA
     The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
     she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
     Thou art resolved?
LEONINE
     I am resolved.
     Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers
MARINA
     No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
     To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
     The purple violets, and marigolds,
     Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
     While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
     Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
     This world to me is like a lasting storm,
     Whirring me from my friends.
DIONYZA
     How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
     How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
     Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
     A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
     With this unprofitable woe!
     Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
     Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
     And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
     Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
MARINA
     No, I pray you;
     I'll not bereave you of your servant.
DIONYZA
     Come, come;
     I love the king your father, and yourself,
     With more than foreign heart. We every day
     Expect him here: when he shall come and find
     Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
     He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
     Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
     No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
     Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
     That excellent complexion, which did steal
     The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
     I can go home alone.
MARINA
     Well, I will go;
     But yet I have no desire to it.
DIONYZA
     Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
     Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
     Remember what I have said.
LEONINE
     I warrant you, madam.
DIONYZA
     I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:
     Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
     What! I must have a care of you.
MARINA
     My thanks, sweet madam.
     Exit DIONYZA
     Is this wind westerly that blows?
LEONINE
     South-west.
MARINA
     When I was born, the wind was north.
LEONINE
     Was't so?
MARINA
     My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
     But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling
     His kingly hands, haling ropes;
     And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
     That almost burst the deck.
LEONINE
     When was this?
MARINA
     When I was born:
     Never was waves nor wind more violent;
     And from the ladder-tackle washes off
     A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
     And with a dropping industry they skip
     From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
     The master calls, and trebles their confusion.
LEONINE
     Come, say your prayers.
MARINA
     What mean you?
LEONINE
     If you require a little space for prayer,
     I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
     For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
     To do my work with haste.
MARINA
     Why will you kill me?
LEONINE
     To satisfy my lady.
MARINA
     Why would she have me kill'd?
     Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
     I never did her hurt in all my life:
     I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
     To any living creature: believe me, la,
     I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
     I trod upon a worm against my will,
     But I wept for it. How have I offended,
     Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
     Or my life imply her any danger?
LEONINE
     My commission
     Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
MARINA
     You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
     You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
     You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
     When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
     Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
     Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
     And save poor me, the weaker.
LEONINE
     I am sworn,
     And will dispatch.
     He seizes her
     Enter Pirates
First Pirate
     Hold, villain!
     LEONINE runs away
Second Pirate
     A prize! a prize!
Third Pirate
     Half-part, mates, half-part.
     Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.
     Exeunt Pirates with MARINA
     Re-enter LEONINE
LEONINE
     These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
     And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
     There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
     she's dead,
     And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
     Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
     Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
     Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel. ****
     Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT
Pandar
     Boult!
BOULT
     Sir?
Pandar
     Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
     gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
     too wenchless.
Bawd
     We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
     poor three, and they can do no more than they can
     do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
Pandar
     Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for
     them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
     every trade, we shall never prosper.
Bawd
     Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
     bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--
BOULT
     Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But
     shall I search the market?
Bawd
     What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
     will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
Pandar
     Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'
     conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that
     lay with the little baggage.
BOULT
     Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat
     for worms. But I'll go search the market.
     Exit
Pandar
     Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
     proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
Bawd
     Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get
     when we are old?
Pandar
     O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor
     the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,
     if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
     estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.
     Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
     will be strong with us for giving over.
Bawd
     Come, other sorts offend as well as we.
Pandar
     As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.
     Neither is our profession any trade; it's no
     calling. But here comes Boult.
     Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA
BOULT
     [To MARINA] Come your ways. My masters, you say
     she's a virgin?
First Pirate
     O, sir, we doubt it not.
BOULT
     Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:
     if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.
Bawd
     Boult, has she any qualities?
BOULT
     She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent
     good clothes: there's no further necessity of
     qualities can make her be refused.
Bawd
     What's her price, Boult?
BOULT
     I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
Pandar
     Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your
     money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her
     what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her
     entertainment.
     Exeunt Pandar and Pirates
Bawd
     Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her
     hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her
     virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall
     have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
     thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done
     as I command you.
BOULT
     Performance shall follow.
     Exit
MARINA
     Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
     He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
     Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me
     For to seek my mother!
Bawd
     Why lament you, pretty one?
MARINA
     That I am pretty.
Bawd
     Come, the gods have done their part in you.
MARINA
     I accuse them not.
Bawd
     You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.
MARINA
     The more my fault
     To scape his hands where I was like to die.
Bawd
     Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
MARINA
     No.
Bawd
     Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
     fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the
     difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?
MARINA
     Are you a woman?
Bawd
     What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?
MARINA
     An honest woman, or not a woman.
Bawd
     Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have
     something to do with you. Come, you're a young
     foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have
     you.
MARINA
     The gods defend me!
Bawd
     If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men
     must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir
     you up. Boult's returned.
     Re-enter BOULT
     Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
BOULT
     I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;
     I have drawn her picture with my voice.
Bawd
     And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the
     inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
BOULT
     'Faith, they listened to me as they would have
     hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
     Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to
     her very description.
Bawd
     We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.
BOULT
     To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the
     French knight that cowers i' the hams?
Bawd
     Who, Monsieur Veroles?
BOULT
     Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the
     proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore
     he would see her to-morrow.
Bawd
     Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease
     hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
     come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the
     sun.
BOULT
     Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we
     should lodge them with this sign.
Bawd
     [To MARINA] Pray you, come hither awhile. You
     have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must
     seem to do that fearfully which you commit
     willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.
     To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
     lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
     opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
MARINA
     I understand you not.
BOULT
     O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
     blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.
Bawd
     Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your
     bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
     with warrant.
BOULT
     'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if
     I have bargained for the joint,--
Bawd
     Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
BOULT
     I may so.
Bawd
     Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the
     manner of your garments well.
BOULT
     Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
Bawd
     Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a
     sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.
     When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good
     turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou
     hast the harvest out of thine own report.
BOULT
     I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake
     the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
     the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
Bawd
     Come your ways; follow me.
MARINA
     If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
     Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
     Diana, aid my purpose!
Bawd
     What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house. ****
     Enter CLEON and DIONYZA
DIONYZA
     Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
CLEON
     O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
     The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
DIONYZA
     I think
     You'll turn a child again.
CLEON
     Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
     I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
     Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
     To equal any single crown o' the earth
     I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
     Whom thou hast poison'd too:
     If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
     Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
     When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
DIONYZA
     That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
     To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
     She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
     Unless you play the pious innocent,
     And for an honest attribute cry out
     'She died by foul play.'
CLEON
     O, go to. Well, well,
     Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
     Do like this worst.
DIONYZA
     Be one of those that think
     The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
     And open this to Pericles. I do shame
     To think of what a noble strain you are,
     And of how coward a spirit.
CLEON
     To such proceeding
     Who ever but his approbation added,
     Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
     From honourable sources.
DIONYZA
     Be it so, then:
     Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
     Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
     She did disdain my child, and stood between
     Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
     But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
     Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
     Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
     And though you call my course unnatural,
     You not your child well loving, yet I find
     It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
     Perform'd to your sole daughter.
CLEON
     Heavens forgive it!
DIONYZA
     And as for Pericles,
     What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
     And yet we mourn: her monument
     Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
     In glittering golden characters express
     A general praise to her, and care in us
     At whose expense 'tis done.
CLEON
     Thou art like the harpy,
     Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
     Seize with thine eagle's talons.
DIONYZA
     You are like one that superstitiously
     Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:
     But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
     Exeunt
     SCENE IV:
     Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus
GOWER
     Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
     Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;
     Making, to take your imagination,
     From bourn to bourn, region to region.
     By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
     To use one language in each several clime
     Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
     To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
     The stages of our story. Pericles
     Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
     Attended on by many a lord and knight.
     To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
     Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
     Advanced in time to great and high estate,
     Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
     Old Helicanus goes along behind.
     Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
     This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
     So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
     To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
     Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
     Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
     DUMB SHOW.
     Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train; CLEON and DIONYZA,
     at the other. CLEON shows PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes
     lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then
     exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA
     See how belief may suffer by foul show!
     This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
     And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
     With sighs shot through, and biggest tears
     o'ershower'd,
     Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
     Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
     He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
     A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
     And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
     The epitaph is for Marina writ
     By wicked Dionyza.
     Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument
     'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
     Who wither'd in her spring of year.
     She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
     On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
     Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
     Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
     Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
     Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
     Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
     Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
     No visor does become black villany
     So well as soft and tender flattery.
     Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
     And bear his courses to be ordered
     By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
     His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
     In her unholy service. Patience, then,
     And think you now are all in Mytilene.
     Exit
**** SCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel. ****
     Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen
First Gentleman
     Did you ever hear the like?
Second Gentleman
     No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she
     being once gone.
First Gentleman
     But to have divinity preached there! did you ever
     dream of such a thing?
Second Gentleman
     No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:
     shall's go hear the vestals sing?
First Gentleman
     I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I
     am out of the road of rutting for ever.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel. ****
     Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT
Pandar
     Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she
     had ne'er come here.
Bawd
     Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god
     Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
     either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
     should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
     kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
     her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
     knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,
     if he should cheapen a kiss of her.
BOULT
     'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us
     of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.
Pandar
     Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
Bawd
     'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the
     way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.
BOULT
     We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish
     baggage would but give way to customers.
     Enter LYSIMACHUS
LYSIMACHUS
     How now! How a dozen of virginities?
Bawd
     Now, the gods to-bless your honour!
BOULT
     I am glad to see your honour in good health.
LYSIMACHUS
     You may so; 'tis the better for you that your
     resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
     wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
     withal, and defy the surgeon?
Bawd
     We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never
     came her like in Mytilene.
LYSIMACHUS
     If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.
Bawd
     Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.
LYSIMACHUS
     Well, call forth, call forth.
BOULT
     For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
     see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--
LYSIMACHUS
     What, prithee?
BOULT
     O, sir, I can be modest.
LYSIMACHUS
     That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it
     gives a good report to a number to be chaste.
     Exit BOULT
Bawd
     Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never
     plucked yet, I can assure you.
     Re-enter BOULT with MARINA
     Is she not a fair creature?
LYSIMACHUS
     'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
     Well, there's for you: leave us.
Bawd
     I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and
     I'll have done presently.
LYSIMACHUS
     I beseech you, do.
Bawd
     [To MARINA] First, I would have you note, this is
     an honourable man.
MARINA
     I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
Bawd
     Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man
     whom I am bound to.
MARINA
     If he govern the country, you are bound to him
     indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.
Bawd
     Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will
     you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
MARINA
     What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
LYSIMACHUS
     Ha' you done?
Bawd
     My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
     pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will
     leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.
     Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT
LYSIMACHUS
     Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?
MARINA
     What trade, sir?
LYSIMACHUS
     Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.
MARINA
     I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.
LYSIMACHUS
     How long have you been of this profession?
MARINA
     E'er since I can remember.
LYSIMACHUS
     Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at
     five or at seven?
MARINA
     Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
LYSIMACHUS
     Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
     creature of sale.
MARINA
     Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,
     and will come into 't? I hear say you are of
     honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
LYSIMACHUS
     Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?
MARINA
     Who is my principal?
LYSIMACHUS
     Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots
     of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something
     of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious
     wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my
     authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly
     upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:
     come, come.
MARINA
     If you were born to honour, show it now;
     If put upon you, make the judgment good
     That thought you worthy of it.
LYSIMACHUS
     How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.
MARINA
     For me,
     That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
     Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
     Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,
     O, that the gods
     Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
     Though they did change me to the meanest bird
     That flies i' the purer air!
LYSIMACHUS
     I did not think
     Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
     Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
     Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:
     Persever in that clear way thou goest,
     And the gods strengthen thee!
MARINA
     The good gods preserve you!
LYSIMACHUS
     For me, be you thoughten
     That I came with no ill intent; for to me
     The very doors and windows savour vilely.
     Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and
     I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.
     Hold, here's more gold for thee.
     A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
     That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
     Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.
     Re-enter BOULT
BOULT
     I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
LYSIMACHUS
     Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!
     Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,
     Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!
     Exit
BOULT
     How's this? We must take another course with you.
     If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a
     breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,
     shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like
     a spaniel. Come your ways.
MARINA
     Whither would you have me?
BOULT
     I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common
     hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll
     have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.
     Re-enter Bawd
Bawd
     How now! what's the matter?
BOULT
     Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy
     words to the Lord Lysimachus.
Bawd
     O abominable!
BOULT
     She makes our profession as it were to stink afore
     the face of the gods.
Bawd
     Marry, hang her up for ever!
BOULT
     The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
     nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
     snowball; saying his prayers too.
Bawd
     Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:
     crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.
BOULT
     An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
     is, she shall be ploughed.
MARINA
     Hark, hark, you gods!
Bawd
     She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
     come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
     to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
     Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!
     Exit
BOULT
     Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
MARINA
     Whither wilt thou have me?
BOULT
     To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
MARINA
     Prithee, tell me one thing first.
BOULT
     Come now, your one thing.
MARINA
     What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
BOULT
     Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
MARINA
     Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
     Since they do better thee in their command.
     Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
     Of hell would not in reputation change:
     Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
     Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
     To the choleric fisting of every rogue
     Thy ear is liable; thy food is such
     As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
BOULT
     What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
     you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
     of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to
     buy him a wooden one?
MARINA
     Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
     OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
     Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
     Any of these ways are yet better than this;
     For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
     Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
     Would safely deliver me from this place!
     Here, here's gold for thee.
     If that thy master would gain by thee,
     Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
     With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:
     And I will undertake all these to teach.
     I doubt not but this populous city will
     Yield many scholars.
BOULT
     But can you teach all this you speak of?
MARINA
     Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
     And prostitute me to the basest groom
     That doth frequent your house.
BOULT
     Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can
     place thee, I will.
MARINA
     But amongst honest women.
BOULT
     'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
     But since my master and mistress have bought you,
     there's no going but by their consent: therefore I
     will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I
     doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.
     Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.
     Exeunt
**** ACT V ****
     Enter GOWER
GOWER
     Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
     Into an honest house, our story says.
     She sings like one immortal, and she dances
     As goddess-like to her admired lays;
     Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
     Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
     That even her art sisters the natural roses;
     Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
     That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
     Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
     She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
     And to her father turn our thoughts again,
     Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;
     Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
     Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
     Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
     God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
     Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
     His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
     And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
     In your supposing once more put your sight
     Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
     Where what is done in action, more, if might,
     Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
     Exit
**** SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close ****
     pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES
     within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying
     beside the Tyrian vessel.
     Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to
     the barge; to them HELICANUS
Tyrian Sailor
     [To the Sailor of Mytilene] Where is lord Helicanus?
     he can resolve you.
     O, here he is.
     Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,
     And in it is Lysimachus the governor,
     Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?
HELICANUS
     That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.
Tyrian Sailor
     Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.
     Enter two or three Gentlemen
First Gentleman
     Doth your lordship call?
HELICANUS
     Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;
     I pray ye, greet them fairly.
     The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge
     Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the
     two Sailors
Tyrian Sailor
     Sir,
     This is the man that can, in aught you would,
     Resolve you.
LYSIMACHUS
     Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!
HELICANUS
     And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
     And die as I would do.
LYSIMACHUS
     You wish me well.
     Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
     Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
     I made to it, to know of whence you are.
HELICANUS
     First, what is your place?
LYSIMACHUS
     I am the governor of this place you lie before.
HELICANUS
     Sir,
     Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
     A man who for this three months hath not spoken
     To any one, nor taken sustenance
     But to prorogue his grief.
LYSIMACHUS
     Upon what ground is his distemperature?
HELICANUS
     'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
     But the main grief springs from the loss
     Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
LYSIMACHUS
     May we not see him?
HELICANUS
     You may;
     But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.
LYSIMACHUS
     Yet let me obtain my wish.
HELICANUS
     Behold him.
     PERICLES discovered
     This was a goodly person,
     Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
     Drove him to this.
LYSIMACHUS
     Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
     Hail, royal sir!
HELICANUS
     It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
First Lord
     Sir,
     We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
     Would win some words of him.
LYSIMACHUS
     'Tis well bethought.
     She questionless with her sweet harmony
     And other chosen attractions, would allure,
     And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
     Which now are midway stopp'd:
     She is all happy as the fairest of all,
     And, with her fellow maids is now upon
     The leafy shelter that abuts against
     The island's side.
     Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS
HELICANUS
     Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
     That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
     We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
     That for our gold we may provision have,
     Wherein we are not destitute for want,
     But weary for the staleness.
LYSIMACHUS
     O, sir, a courtesy
     Which if we should deny, the most just gods
     For every graff would send a caterpillar,
     And so afflict our province. Yet once more
     Let me entreat to know at large the cause
     Of your king's sorrow.
HELICANUS
     Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
     But, see, I am prevented.
     Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady
LYSIMACHUS
     O, here is
     The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
     Is't not a goodly presence?
HELICANUS
     She's a gallant lady.
LYSIMACHUS
     She's such a one, that, were I well assured
     Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
     I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.
     Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
     Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:
     If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
     Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
     Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
     As thy desires can wish.
MARINA
     Sir, I will use
     My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided
     That none but I and my companion maid
     Be suffer'd to come near him.
LYSIMACHUS
     Come, let us leave her;
     And the gods make her prosperous!
     MARINA sings
LYSIMACHUS
     Mark'd he your music?
MARINA
     No, nor look'd on us.
LYSIMACHUS
     See, she will speak to him.
MARINA
     Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.
PERICLES
     Hum, ha!
MARINA
     I am a maid,
     My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
     But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
     My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
     Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
     Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
     My derivation was from ancestors
     Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
     But time hath rooted out my parentage,
     And to the world and awkward casualties
     Bound me in servitude.
     Aside
     I will desist;
     But there is something glows upon my cheek,
     And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'
PERICLES
     My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
     To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?
MARINA
     I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
     You would not do me violence.
PERICLES
     I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
     You are like something that--What country-woman?
     Here of these shores?
MARINA
     No, nor of any shores:
     Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
     No other than I appear.
PERICLES
     I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
     My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
     My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
     Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
     As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
     And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
     Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
     The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
MARINA
     Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
     You may discern the place.
PERICLES
     Where were you bred?
     And how achieved you these endowments, which
     You make more rich to owe?
MARINA
     If I should tell my history, it would seem
     Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
PERICLES
     Prithee, speak:
     Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
     Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
     For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
     believe thee,
     And make my senses credit thy relation
     To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
     Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
     Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
     Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
     From good descending?
MARINA
     So indeed I did.
PERICLES
     Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
     Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
     And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
     If both were open'd.
MARINA
     Some such thing
     I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
     Did warrant me was likely.
PERICLES
     Tell thy story;
     If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
     Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
     Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
     Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
     Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
     How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
     Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.
MARINA
     My name is Marina.
PERICLES
     O, I am mock'd,
     And thou by some incensed god sent hither
     To make the world to laugh at me.
MARINA
     Patience, good sir,
     Or here I'll cease.
PERICLES
     Nay, I'll be patient.
     Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
     To call thyself Marina.
MARINA
     The name
     Was given me by one that had some power,
     My father, and a king.
PERICLES
     How! a king's daughter?
     And call'd Marina?
MARINA
     You said you would believe me;
     But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
     I will end here.
PERICLES
     But are you flesh and blood?
     Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
     Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
     And wherefore call'd Marina?
MARINA
     Call'd Marina
     For I was born at sea.
PERICLES
     At sea! what mother?
MARINA
     My mother was the daughter of a king;
     Who died the minute I was born,
     As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
     Deliver'd weeping.
PERICLES
     O, stop there a little!
     Aside
     This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
     Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
     My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
     I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
     And never interrupt you.
MARINA
     You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
PERICLES
     I will believe you by the syllable
     Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
     How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
MARINA
     The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
     Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
     Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
     A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
     A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
     Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
     Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
     It may be,
     You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
     I am the daughter to King Pericles,
     If good King Pericles be.
PERICLES
     Ho, Helicanus!
HELICANUS
     Calls my lord?
PERICLES
     Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
     Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
     What this maid is, or what is like to be,
     That thus hath made me weep?
HELICANUS
     I know not; but
     Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
     Speaks nobly of her.
LYSIMACHUS
     She would never tell
     Her parentage; being demanded that,
     She would sit still and weep.
PERICLES
     O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;
     Give me a gash, put me to present pain;
     Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
     O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
     And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
     Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
     Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
     And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
     Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
     As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
     What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
     For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
     Though doubts did ever sleep.
MARINA
     First, sir, I pray,
     What is your title?
PERICLES
     I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
     My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
     Thou hast been godlike perfect,
     The heir of kingdoms and another like
     To Pericles thy father.
MARINA
     Is it no more to be your daughter than
     To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
     Thaisa was my mother, who did end
     The minute I began.
PERICLES
     Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
     Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
     She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
     By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;
     When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
     She is thy very princess. Who is this?
HELICANUS
     Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
     Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
     Did come to see you.
PERICLES
     I embrace you.
     Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
     O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?
     Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
     O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
     How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?
HELICANUS
     My lord, I hear none.
PERICLES
     None!
     The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.
LYSIMACHUS
     It is not good to cross him; give him way.
PERICLES
     Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?
LYSIMACHUS
     My lord, I hear.
     Music
PERICLES
     Most heavenly music!
     It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber
     Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.
     Sleeps

     A pillow for his head:
     So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
     If this but answer to my just belief,
     I'll well remember you.
     Exeunt all but PERICLES
     DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision
DIANA
     My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,
     And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
     There, when my maiden priests are met together,
     Before the people all,
     Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
     To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
     And give them repetition to the life.
     Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
     Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
     Awake, and tell thy dream.
     Disappears
PERICLES
     Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
     I will obey thee. Helicanus!
     Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA
HELICANUS
     Sir?
PERICLES
     My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
     The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
     For other service first: toward Ephesus
     Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
     To LYSIMACHUS
     Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
     And give you gold for such provision
     As our intents will need?
LYSIMACHUS
     Sir,
     With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,
     I have another suit.
PERICLES
     You shall prevail,
     Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
     You have been noble towards her.
LYSIMACHUS
     Sir, lend me your arm.
PERICLES
     Come, my Marina.
     Exeunt
     SCENE II:
     Enter GOWER, before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus
GOWER
     Now our sands are almost run;
     More a little, and then dumb.
     This, my last boon, give me,
     For such kindness must relieve me,
     That you aptly will suppose
     What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
     What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
     The regent made in Mytilene
     To greet the king. So he thrived,
     That he is promised to be wived
     To fair Marina; but in no wise
     Till he had done his sacrifice,
     As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
     The interim, pray you, all confound.
     In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
     And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
     At Ephesus, the temple see,
     Our king and all his company.
     That he can hither come so soon,
     Is by your fancy's thankful doom.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing ****
     near the altar, as high priestess; a number of
     Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants
     of Ephesus attending.
     Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS, HELICANUS, MARINA, and a
     Lady
PERICLES
     Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
     I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
     Who, frighted from my country, did wed
     At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
     At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
     A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,
     Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
     Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
     He sought to murder: but her better stars
     Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
     Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
     Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
     Made known herself my daughter.
THAISA
     Voice and favour!
     You are, you are--O royal Pericles!
     Faints
PERICLES
     What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!
CERIMON
     Noble sir,
     If you have told Diana's altar true,
     This is your wife.
PERICLES
     Reverend appearer, no;
     I threw her overboard with these very arms.
CERIMON
     Upon this coast, I warrant you.
PERICLES
     'Tis most certain.
CERIMON
     Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
     Early in blustering morn this lady was
     Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
     Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
     Here in Diana's temple.
PERICLES
     May we see them?
CERIMON
     Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
     Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.
THAISA
     O, let me look!
     If he be none of mine, my sanctity
     Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
     But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
     Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,
     Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,
     A birth, and death?
PERICLES
     The voice of dead Thaisa!
THAISA
     That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
     And drown'd.
PERICLES
     Immortal Dian!
THAISA
     Now I know you better.
     When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
     The king my father gave you such a ring.
     Shows a ring
PERICLES
     This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
     Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
     That on the touching of her lips I may
     Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
     A second time within these arms.
MARINA
     My heart
     Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
     Kneels to THAISA
PERICLES
     Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
     Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina
     For she was yielded there.
THAISA
     Blest, and mine own!
HELICANUS
     Hail, madam, and my queen!
THAISA
     I know you not.
PERICLES
     You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
     I left behind an ancient substitute:
     Can you remember what I call'd the man?
     I have named him oft.
THAISA
     'Twas Helicanus then.
PERICLES
     Still confirmation:
     Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
     Now do I long to hear how you were found;
     How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
     Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
THAISA
     Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
     Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
     From first to last resolve you.
PERICLES
     Reverend sir,
     The gods can have no mortal officer
     More like a god than you. Will you deliver
     How this dead queen re-lives?
CERIMON
     I will, my lord.
     Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
     Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
     How she came placed here in the temple;
     No needful thing omitted.
PERICLES
     Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
     Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
     This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
     Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,
     This ornament
     Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
     And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,
     To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.
THAISA
     Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
     My father's dead.
PERICLES
     Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
     We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
     Will in that kingdom spend our following days:
     Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
     Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
     To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.
     Exeunt
     Enter GOWER
GOWER
     In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
     Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
     In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
     Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
     Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
     Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
     In Helicanus may you well descry
     A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
     In reverend Cerimon there well appears
     The worth that learned charity aye wears:
     For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
     Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
     Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
     That him and his they in his palace burn;
     The gods for murder seemed so content
     To punish them; although not done, but meant.
     So, on your patience evermore attending,
     New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
     Exit
The Second part of King Henry the Fourth
     Warkworth. Before the castle
     Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues
RUMOUR
     Open your ears; for which of you will stop
     The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
     I, from the orient to the drooping west,
     Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
     The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
     Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
     The which in every language I pronounce,
     Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
     I speak of peace, while covert enmity
     Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
     And who but Rumour, who but only I,
     Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
     Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
     Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
     And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
     Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
     And of so easy and so plain a stop
     That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
     The still-discordant wavering multitude,
     Can play upon it. But what need I thus
     My well-known body to anatomize
     Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
     I run before King Harry's victory;
     Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
     Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
     Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
     Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I
     To speak so true at first? my office is
     To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
     Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
     And that the king before the Douglas' rage
     Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
     This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
     Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
     And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
     Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
     Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
     And not a man of them brings other news
     Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
     They bring smooth comforts false, worse than
     true wrongs.

**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. The same. ****
     Enter LORD BARDOLPH
LORD BARDOLPH
     Who keeps the gate here, ho?
     The Porter opens the gate
     Where is the earl?
Porter
     What shall I say you are?
LORD BARDOLPH
     Tell thou the earl
     That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
Porter
     His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;
     Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,
     And he himself wilt answer.
     Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
LORD BARDOLPH
     Here comes the earl.
     Exit Porter
NORTHUMBERLAND
     What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
     Should be the father of some stratagem:
     The times are wild: contention, like a horse
     Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
     And bears down all before him.
LORD BARDOLPH
     Noble earl,
     I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Good, an God will!
LORD BARDOLPH
     As good as heart can wish:
     The king is almost wounded to the death;
     And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
     Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
     Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
     And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
     And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
     Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,
     So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,
     Came not till now to dignify the times,
     Since Caesar's fortunes!
NORTHUMBERLAND
     How is this derived?
     Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
LORD BARDOLPH
     I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
     A gentleman well bred and of good name,
     That freely render'd me these news for true.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
     On Tuesday last to listen after news.
     Enter TRAVERS
LORD BARDOLPH
     My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
     And he is furnish'd with no certainties
     More than he haply may retail from me.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
TRAVERS
     My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
     With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,
     Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
     A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
     That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
     He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
     I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
     He told me that rebellion had bad luck
     And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
     With that, he gave his able horse the head,
     And bending forward struck his armed heels
     Against the panting sides of his poor jade
     Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
     He seem'd in running to devour the way,
     Staying no longer question.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Ha! Again:
     Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
     Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
     Had met ill luck?
LORD BARDOLPH
     My lord, I'll tell you what;
     If my young lord your son have not the day,
     Upon mine honour, for a silken point
     I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
     Give then such instances of loss?
LORD BARDOLPH
     Who, he?
     He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
     The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
     Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
     Enter MORTON
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
     Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
     So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
     Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
     Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
MORTON
     I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
     Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
     To fright our party.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     How doth my son and brother?
     Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
     Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
     Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
     So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
     Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
     And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
     But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
     And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
     This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
     Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
     Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
     But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
     Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
     Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
MORTON
     Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
     But, for my lord your son--
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Why, he is dead.
     See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
     He that but fears the thing he would not know
     Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
     That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;
     Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
     And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
     And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
MORTON
     You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
     Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
     I see a strange confession in thine eye:
     Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
     To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
     The tongue offends not that reports his death:
     And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
     Not he which says the dead is not alive.
     Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
     Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
     Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
     Remember'd tolling a departing friend.
LORD BARDOLPH
     I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
MORTON
     I am sorry I should force you to believe
     That which I would to God I had not seen;
     But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
     Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,
     To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
     The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
     From whence with life he never more sprung up.
     In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
     Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
     Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
     From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
     For from his metal was his party steel'd;
     Which once in him abated, all the rest
     Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
     And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
     Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
     So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
     Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
     That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
     Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
     Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
     Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
     The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
     Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
     'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
     Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
     Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
     Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
     A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
     Under the conduct of young Lancaster
     And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
     In poison there is physic; and these news,
     Having been well, that would have made me sick,
     Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
     And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
     Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
     Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
     Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
     Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,
     Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
     A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
     Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
     Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
     Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
     Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
     The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
     To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
     Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
     Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
     And let this world no longer be a stage
     To feed contention in a lingering act;
     But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
     Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
     On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
     And darkness be the burier of the dead!
TRAVERS
     This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
LORD BARDOLPH
     Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
MORTON
     The lives of all your loving complices
     Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
     To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
     You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
     And summ'd the account of chance, before you said
     'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,
     That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:
     You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,
     More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
     You were advised his flesh was capable
     Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
     Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
     Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,
     Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
     The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
     Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
     More than that being which was like to be?
LORD BARDOLPH
     We all that are engaged to this loss
     Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
     That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;
     And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
     Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
     And since we are o'erset, venture again.
     Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
MORTON
     'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
     I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
     The gentle Archbishop of York is up
     With well-appointed powers: he is a man
     Who with a double surety binds his followers.
     My lord your son had only but the corpse,
     But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
     For that same word, rebellion, did divide
     The action of their bodies from their souls;
     And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
     As men drink potions, that their weapons only
     Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,
     This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
     As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
     Turns insurrection to religion:
     Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,
     He's followed both with body and with mind;
     And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
     Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;
     Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
     Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
     Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
     And more and less do flock to follow him.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
     This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
     Go in with me; and counsel every man
     The aptest way for safety and revenge:
     Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
     Never so few, and never yet more need.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. A street. ****
     Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler
FALSTAFF
     Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
Page
     He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy
     water; but, for the party that owed it, he might
     have more diseases than he knew for.
FALSTAFF
     Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
     brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not
     able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more
     than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
     witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other
     men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
     hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
     prince put thee into my service for any other reason
     than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
     Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn
     in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
     manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
     neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and
     send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--
     the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is
     not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
     the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
     cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
     a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis
     not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a
     face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence
     out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
     writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
     may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,
     I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
     the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
Page
     He said, sir, you should procure him better
     assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his
     band and yours; he liked not the security.
FALSTAFF
     Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his
     tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally
     yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,
     and then stand upon security! The whoreson
     smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
     bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
     through with them in honest taking up, then they
     must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
     put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
     security. I looked a' should have sent me two and
     twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he
     sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;
     for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness
     of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he
     see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.
     Where's Bardolph?
Page
     He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.
FALSTAFF
     I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in
     Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the
     stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.
     Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant
Page
     Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the
     Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
FALSTAFF
     Wait, close; I will not see him.
     Lord Chief-Justice What's he that goes there?
Servant
     Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
     Lord Chief-Justice He that was in question for the robbery?
Servant
     He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at
     Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some
     charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.
     Lord Chief-Justice What, to York? Call him back again.
Servant
     Sir John Falstaff!
FALSTAFF
     Boy, tell him I am deaf.
Page
     You must speak louder; my master is deaf.
     Lord Chief-Justice I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
     Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.
Servant
     Sir John!
FALSTAFF
     What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not
     wars? is there not employment? doth not the king
     lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?
     Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it
     is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,
     were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
     how to make it.
Servant
     You mistake me, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting
     my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied
     in my throat, if I had said so.
Servant
     I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our
     soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,
     you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other
     than an honest man.
FALSTAFF
     I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
     which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,
     hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be
     hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!
Servant
     Sir, my lord would speak with you.
     Lord Chief-Justice Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
FALSTAFF
     My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
     day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
     say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
     goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not
     clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in
     you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must
     humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
     of your health.
     Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
     Shrewsbury.
FALSTAFF
     An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is
     returned with some discomfort from Wales.
     Lord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
     I sent for you.
FALSTAFF
     And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into
     this same whoreson apoplexy.
     Lord Chief-Justice Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with
     you.
FALSTAFF
     This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,
     an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
     blood, a whoreson tingling.
     Lord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
FALSTAFF
     It hath its original from much grief, from study and
     perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
     his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.
     Lord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease; for you
     hear not what I say to you.
FALSTAFF
     Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please
     you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady
     of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
     Lord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the
     attention of your ears; and I care not if I do
     become your physician.
FALSTAFF
     I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:
     your lordship may minister the potion of
     imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
     should I be your patient to follow your
     prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a
     scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
     Lord Chief-Justice I sent for you, when there were matters against
     you
     for your life, to come speak with me.
FALSTAFF
     As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the
     laws of this land-service, I did not come.
     Lord Chief-Justice Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great
     infamy.
FALSTAFF
     He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
     Lord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender, and your waste is
     great.
FALSTAFF
     I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
     greater, and my waist slenderer.
     Lord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince.
FALSTAFF
     The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow
     with the great belly, and he my dog.
     Lord Chief-Justice Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your
     day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
     over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may
     thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting
     that action.
FALSTAFF
     My lord?
     Lord Chief-Justice But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
     sleeping wolf.
FALSTAFF
     To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
     Lord Chief-Justice What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
     out.
FALSTAFF
     A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say
     of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
     Lord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should
     have his effect of gravity.
FALSTAFF
     His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
     Lord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down, like his
     ill angel.
FALSTAFF
     Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope
     he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
     and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I
     cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
     costermonger times that true valour is turned
     bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath
     his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
     other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
     this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.
     You that are old consider not the capacities of us
     that are young; you do measure the heat of our
     livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
     that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,
     are wags too.
     Lord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
     that are written down old with all the characters of
     age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a
     yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
     increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
     wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
     every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
     will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
FALSTAFF
     My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the
     afternoon, with a white head and something a round
     belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing
     and singing of anthems. To approve my youth
     further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in
     judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
     with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the
     money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that
     the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
     and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
     chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
     marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
     and old sack.
     Lord Chief-Justice Well, God send the prince a better companion!
FALSTAFF
     God send the companion a better prince! I cannot
     rid my hands of him.
     Lord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry:
     I
     hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
     against the Archbishop and the Earl of
     Northumberland.
FALSTAFF
     Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
     you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
     that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the
     Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean
     not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,
     and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I
     might never spit white again. There is not a
     dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
     thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
     was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if
     they have a good thing, to make it too common. If
     ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give
     me rest. I would to God my name were not so
     terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
     eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
     nothing with perpetual motion.
     Lord Chief-Justice Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your
     expedition!
FALSTAFF
     Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
     furnish me forth?
     Lord Chief-Justice Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to
     bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my
     cousin Westmoreland.
     Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant
FALSTAFF
     If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man
     can no more separate age and covetousness than a'
     can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout
     galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and
     so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!
Page
     Sir?
FALSTAFF
     What money is in my purse?
Page
     Seven groats and two pence.
FALSTAFF
     I can get no remedy against this consumption of the
     purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,
     but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter
     to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this
     to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old
     Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry
     since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.
     About it: you know where to find me.
     Exit Page
     A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for
     the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
     toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars
     for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more
     reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:
     I will turn diseases to commodity.

**** SCENE III. York. The Archbishop's palace. ****
     Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and
     BARDOLPH
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
     And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,
     Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
     And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?
MOWBRAY
     I well allow the occasion of our arms;
     But gladly would be better satisfied
     How in our means we should advance ourselves
     To look with forehead bold and big enough
     Upon the power and puissance of the king.
HASTINGS
     Our present musters grow upon the file
     To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
     And our supplies live largely in the hope
     Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
     With an incensed fire of injuries.
LORD BARDOLPH
     The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;
     Whether our present five and twenty thousand
     May hold up head without Northumberland?
HASTINGS
     With him, we may.
LORD BARDOLPH
     Yea, marry, there's the point:
     But if without him we be thought too feeble,
     My judgment is, we should not step too far
     Till we had his assistance by the hand;
     For in a theme so bloody-faced as this
     Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
     Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed
     It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
LORD BARDOLPH
     It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
     Eating the air on promise of supply,
     Flattering himself in project of a power
     Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:
     And so, with great imagination
     Proper to madmen, led his powers to death
     And winking leap'd into destruction.
HASTINGS
     But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
     To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
LORD BARDOLPH
     Yes, if this present quality of war,
     Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
     Lives so in hope as in an early spring
     We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,
     Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
     That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
     We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
     And when we see the figure of the house,
     Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
     Which if we find outweighs ability,
     What do we then but draw anew the model
     In fewer offices, or at last desist
     To build at all? Much more, in this great work,
     Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
     And set another up, should we survey
     The plot of situation and the model,
     Consent upon a sure foundation,
     Question surveyors, know our own estate,
     How able such a work to undergo,
     To weigh against his opposite; or else
     We fortify in paper and in figures,
     Using the names of men instead of men:
     Like one that draws the model of a house
     Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
     Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
     A naked subject to the weeping clouds
     And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
HASTINGS
     Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
     Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
     The utmost man of expectation,
     I think we are a body strong enough,
     Even as we are, to equal with the king.
LORD BARDOLPH
     What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?
HASTINGS
     To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
     For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
     Are in three heads: one power against the French,
     And one against Glendower; perforce a third
     Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
     In three divided; and his coffers sound
     With hollow poverty and emptiness.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     That he should draw his several strengths together
     And come against us in full puissance,
     Need not be dreaded.
HASTINGS
     If he should do so,
     He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
     Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
LORD BARDOLPH
     Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
HASTINGS
     The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
     Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
     But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
     I have no certain notice.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Let us on,
     And publish the occasion of our arms.
     The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
     Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:
     An habitation giddy and unsure
     Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
     O thou fond many, with what loud applause
     Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,
     Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
     And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
     Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,
     That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.
     So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
     Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;
     And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
     And howl'st to find it. What trust is in
     these times?
     They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,
     Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
     Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
     When through proud London he came sighing on
     After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
     Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,
     And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!
     Past and to come seems best; things present worst.
MOWBRAY
     Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?
HASTINGS
     We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. London. A street. ****
     Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her, and SNARE
     following.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Master Fang, have you entered the action?
FANG
     It is entered.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'
     stand to 't?
FANG
     Sirrah, where's Snare?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.
SNARE
     Here, here.
FANG
     Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.
SNARE
     It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in
     mine own house, and that most beastly: in good
     faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his
     weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will
     spare neither man, woman, nor child.
FANG
     If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.
FANG
     An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an
     infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,
     hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not
     'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--saving
     your manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited to
     dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to
     Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my
     exion is entered and my case so openly known to the
     world, let him be brought in to his answer. A
     hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to
     bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and
     have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed
     off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame
     to be thought on. There is no honesty in such
     dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a
     beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he
     comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,
     with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master
     Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.
     Enter FALSTAFF, Page, and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF
     How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?
FANG
     Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.
FALSTAFF
     Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the
     villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the
     channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly
     rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle
     villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the
     king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a
     honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.
FALSTAFF
     Keep them off, Bardolph.
FANG
     A rescue! a rescue!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo't
     thou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,
     thou hemp-seed!
FALSTAFF
     Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You
     fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.
     Enter the Lord Chief-Justice, and his men
     Lord Chief-Justice What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.
     Lord Chief-Justice How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?
     Doth this become your place, your time and business?
     You should have been well on your way to York.
     Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am
     a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.
     Lord Chief-Justice For what sum?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,
     all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;
     he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of
     his: but I will have some of it out again, or I
     will ride thee o' nights like the mare.
FALSTAFF
     I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have
     any vantage of ground to get up.
     Lord Chief-Justice How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good
     temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
     Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so
     rough a course to come by her own?
FALSTAFF
     What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the
     money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a
     parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,
     at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon
     Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke
     thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of
     Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was
     washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
     thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife
     Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me
     gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of
     vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;
     whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I
     told thee they were ill for a green wound? And
     didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,
     desire me to be no more so familiarity with such
     poor people; saying that ere long they should call
     me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me
     fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy
     book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.
FALSTAFF
     My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up
     and down the town that the eldest son is like you:
     she hath been in good case, and the truth is,
     poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish
     officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.
     Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
     manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It
     is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words
     that come with such more than impudent sauciness
     from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:
     you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the
     easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her
     serve your uses both in purse and in person.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Yea, in truth, my lord.
     Lord Chief-Justice Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
     and
     unpay the villany you have done her: the one you
     may do with sterling money, and the other with
     current repentance.
FALSTAFF
     My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without
     reply. You call honourable boldness impudent
     sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say
     nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble
     duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say
     to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,
     being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.
     Lord Chief-Justice You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer
     in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this
     poor woman.
FALSTAFF
     Come hither, hostess.
     Enter GOWER
     Lord Chief-Justice Now, Master Gower, what news?
GOWER
     The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
     Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.
FALSTAFF
     As I am a gentleman.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Faith, you said so before.
FALSTAFF
     As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain
     to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my
     dining-chambers.
FALSTAFF
     Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy
     walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of
     the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,
     is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these
     fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou
     canst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's
     not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,
     and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in
     this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I
     know thou wast set on to this.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'
     faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,
     la!
FALSTAFF
     Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a
     fool still.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I
     hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?
FALSTAFF
     Will I live?
     To BARDOLPH
     Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?
FALSTAFF
     No more words; let's have her.
     Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY, BARDOLPH, Officers and Boy
     Lord Chief-Justice I have heard better news.
FALSTAFF
     What's the news, my lord?
     Lord Chief-Justice Where lay the king last night?
GOWER
     At Basingstoke, my lord.
FALSTAFF
     I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?
     Lord Chief-Justice Come all his forces back?
GOWER
     No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
     Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,
     Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
FALSTAFF
     Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?
     Lord Chief-Justice You shall have letters of me presently:
     Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.
FALSTAFF
     My lord!
     Lord Chief-Justice What's the matter?
FALSTAFF
     Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?
GOWER
     I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,
     good Sir John.
     Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are
     to
     take soldiers up in counties as you go.
FALSTAFF
     Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
     Lord Chief-Justice What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir
     John?
FALSTAFF
     Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool
     that taught them me. This is the right fencing
     grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.
     Lord Chief-Justice Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. Another street. ****
     Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE HENRY
     Before God, I am exceeding weary.
POINS
     Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
     have attached one of so high blood.
PRINCE HENRY
     Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
     complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
     it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
POINS
     Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
     to remember so weak a composition.
PRINCE HENRY
     Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
     by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
     small beer. But, indeed, these humble
     considerations make me out of love with my
     greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
     thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
     take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
     hast, viz. these, and those that were thy
     peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
     shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for
     use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
     than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
     thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
     a great while, because the rest of thy low
     countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
     and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins
     of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
     midwives say the children are not in the fault;
     whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
     mightily strengthened.
POINS
     How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
     you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
     young princes would do so, their fathers being so
     sick as yours at this time is?
PRINCE HENRY
     Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
POINS
     Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.
PRINCE HENRY
     It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
POINS
     Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
     will tell.
PRINCE HENRY
     Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
     sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
     thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
     better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
     indeed too.
POINS
     Very hardly upon such a subject.
PRINCE HENRY
     By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
     book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
     persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
     thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
     sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
     hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
POINS
     The reason?
PRINCE HENRY
     What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?
POINS
     I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
PRINCE HENRY
     It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
     blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never
     a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
     better than thine: every man would think me an
     hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
     worshipful thought to think so?
POINS
     Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
     engraffed to Falstaff.
PRINCE HENRY
     And to thee.
POINS
     By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
     with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
     me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
     proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I
     confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.
     Enter BARDOLPH and Page
PRINCE HENRY
     And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from
     me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not
     transformed him ape.
BARDOLPH
     God save your grace!
PRINCE HENRY
     And yours, most noble Bardolph!
BARDOLPH
     Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you
     be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a
     maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a
     matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
Page
     A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red
     lattice, and I could discern no part of his face
     from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and
     methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's
     new petticoat and so peeped through.
PRINCE HENRY
     Has not the boy profited?
BARDOLPH
     Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
Page
     Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
PRINCE HENRY
     Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
Page
     Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered
     of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.
PRINCE HENRY
     A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,
     boy.
POINS
     O, that this good blossom could be kept from
     cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.
BARDOLPH
     An you do not make him hanged among you, the
     gallows shall have wrong.
PRINCE HENRY
     And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
BARDOLPH
     Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to
     town: there's a letter for you.
POINS
     Delivered with good respect. And how doth the
     martlemas, your master?
BARDOLPH
     In bodily health, sir.
POINS
     Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but
     that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies
     not.
PRINCE HENRY
     I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
     dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.
POINS
     [Reads] 'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must
     know that, as oft as he has occasion to name
     himself: even like those that are kin to the king;
     for they never prick their finger but they say,
     'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How
     comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to
     conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's
     cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'
PRINCE HENRY
     Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it
     from Japhet. But to the letter.
POINS
     [Reads] 'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of
     the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of
     Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.
PRINCE HENRY
     Peace!
POINS
     [Reads] 'I will imitate the honourable Romans in
     brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,
     short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend
     thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with
     Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he
     swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent
     at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
     Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to
     say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my
     familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,
     and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'
     My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
PRINCE HENRY
     That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do
     you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?
POINS
     God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the
     spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
     Is your master here in London?
BARDOLPH
     Yea, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY
     Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
BARDOLPH
     At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY
     What company?
Page
     Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
PRINCE HENRY
     Sup any women with him?
Page
     None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and
     Mistress Doll Tearsheet.
PRINCE HENRY
     What pagan may that be?
Page
     A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
PRINCE HENRY
     Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
     bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?
POINS
     I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.
PRINCE HENRY
     Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
     master that I am yet come to town: there's for
     your silence.
BARDOLPH
     I have no tongue, sir.
Page
     And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
PRINCE HENRY
     Fare you well; go.
     Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page
     This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.
POINS
     I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint
     Alban's and London.
PRINCE HENRY
     How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night
     in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?
POINS
     Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait
     upon him at his table as drawers.
PRINCE HENRY
     From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was
     Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low
     transformation! that shall be mine; for in every
     thing the purpose must weigh with the folly.
     Follow me, Ned.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Warkworth. Before the castle. ****
     Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY
NORTHUMBERLAND
     I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,
     Give even way unto my rough affairs:
     Put not you on the visage of the times
     And be like them to Percy troublesome.
     LADY
NORTHUMBERLAND
     I have given over, I will speak no more:
     Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
     And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
LADY PERCY
     O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
     The time was, father, that you broke your word,
     When you were more endeared to it than now;
     When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
     Threw many a northward look to see his father
     Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
     Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
     There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
     For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
     For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
     In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
     Did all the chivalry of England move
     To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
     Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
     He had no legs that practised not his gait;
     And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
     Became the accents of the valiant;
     For those that could speak low and tardily
     Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
     To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
     In diet, in affections of delight,
     In military rules, humours of blood,
     He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
     That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!
     O miracle of men! him did you leave,
     Second to none, unseconded by you,
     To look upon the hideous god of war
     In disadvantage; to abide a field
     Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
     Did seem defensible: so you left him.
     Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
     To hold your honour more precise and nice
     With others than with him! let them alone:
     The marshal and the archbishop are strong:
     Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
     To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
     Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Beshrew your heart,
     Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
     With new lamenting ancient oversights.
     But I must go and meet with danger there,
     Or it will seek me in another place
     And find me worse provided.
     LADY
NORTHUMBERLAND
     O, fly to Scotland,
     Till that the nobles and the armed commons
     Have of their puissance made a little taste.
LADY PERCY
     If they get ground and vantage of the king,
     Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
     To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
     First let them try themselves. So did your son;
     He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;
     And never shall have length of life enough
     To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
     That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
     For recordation to my noble husband.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
     As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
     That makes a still-stand, running neither way:
     Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,
     But many thousand reasons hold me back.
     I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,
     Till time and vantage crave my company.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. The Boar's-head Tavern in Eastcheap. ****
     Enter two Drawers
First Drawer
     What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns?
     thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.
Second Drawer
     Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish
     of apple-johns before him, and told him there were
     five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said
     'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,
     old, withered knights.' It angered him to the
     heart: but he hath forgot that.
First Drawer
     Why, then, cover, and set them down: and see if
     thou canst find out Sneak's noise; Mistress
     Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the
     room where they supped is too hot; they'll come in straight.
Second Drawer
     Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins
     anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and
     aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph
     hath brought word.
First Drawer
     By the mass, here will be old Utis: it will be an
     excellent stratagem.
Second Drawer
     I'll see if I can find out Sneak.
     Exit
     Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an
     excellent good temperality: your pulsidge beats as
     extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your
     colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good
     truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too much
     canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine,
     and it perfumes the blood ere one can say 'What's
     this?' How do you now?
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Better than I was: hem!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth gold.
     Lo, here comes Sir John.
     Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF
     [Singing] 'When Arthur first in court,'
     --Empty the jordan.
     Exit First Drawer
     Singing
     --'And was a worthy king.' How now, Mistress Doll!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.
FALSTAFF
     So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they are sick.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?
FALSTAFF
     You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I
     make them not.
FALSTAFF
     If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to
     make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll, we
     catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue grant that.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.
FALSTAFF
     'Your broaches, pearls, and ouches:' for to serve
     bravely is to come halting off, you know: to come
     off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to
     surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged
     chambers bravely,--
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never
     meet but you fall to some discord: you are both,
     i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you
     cannot one bear with another's confirmities. What
     the good-year! one must bear, and that must be
     you: you are the weaker vessel, as they say, the
     emptier vessel.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
     hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of
     Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk
     better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends
     with thee, Jack: thou art going to the wars; and
     whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is
     nobody cares.
     Re-enter First Drawer
First Drawer
     Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would speak with
     you.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come
     hither: it is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by my
     faith; I must live among my neighbours: I'll no
     swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the
     very best: shut the door; there comes no swaggerers
     here: I have not lived all this while, to have
     swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.
FALSTAFF
     Dost thou hear, hostess?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John: there comes no
     swaggerers here.
FALSTAFF
     Dost thou hear? it is mine ancient.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient
     swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master
     Tisick, the debuty, t'other day; and, as he said to
     me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, 'I'
     good faith, neighbour Quickly,' says he; Master
     Dumbe, our minister, was by then; 'neighbour
     Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that are civil;
     for,' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a'
     said so, I can tell whereupon; 'for,' says he, 'you
     are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore
     take heed what guests you receive: receive,' says
     he, 'no swaggering companions.' There comes none
     here: you would bless you to hear what he said:
     no, I'll no swaggerers.
FALSTAFF
     He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i'
     faith; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy
     greyhound: he'll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if
     her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.
     Call him up, drawer.
     Exit First Drawer
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my
     house, nor no cheater: but I do not love
     swaggering, by my troth; I am the worse, when one
     says swagger: feel, masters, how I shake; look you,
     I warrant you.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     So you do, hostess.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Do I? yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen
     leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.
     Enter PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page
PISTOL
     God save you, Sir John!
FALSTAFF
     Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge
     you with a cup of sack: do you discharge upon mine hostess.
PISTOL
     I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.
FALSTAFF
     She is Pistol-proof, sir; you shall hardly offend
     her.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets: I'll
     drink no more than will do me good, for no man's
     pleasure, I.
PISTOL
     Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What!
     you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen
     mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for
     your master.
PISTOL
     I know you, Mistress Dorothy.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away!
     by this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy
     chaps, an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,
     you bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale
     juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God's
     light, with two points on your shoulder? much!
PISTOL
     God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.
FALSTAFF
     No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off here:
     discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     No, Good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art thou
     not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were
     of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for
     taking their names upon you before you have earned
     them. You a captain! you slave, for what? for
     tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a
     captain! hang him, rogue! he lives upon mouldy
     stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's
     light, these villains will make the word as odious
     as the word 'occupy;' which was an excellent good
     word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains
     had need look to 't.
BARDOLPH
     Pray thee, go down, good ancient.
FALSTAFF
     Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.
PISTOL
     Not I I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could
     tear her: I'll be revenged of her.
Page
     Pray thee, go down.
PISTOL
     I'll see her damned first; to Pluto's damned lake,
     by this hand, to the infernal deep, with Erebus and
     tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.
     Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have we not
     Hiren here?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i'
     faith: I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.
PISTOL
     These be good humours, indeed! Shall pack-horses
     And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
     Which cannot go but thirty mile a-day,
     Compare with Caesars, and with Cannibals,
     And Trojan Greeks? nay, rather damn them with
     King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
     Shall we fall foul for toys?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.
BARDOLPH
     Be gone, good ancient: this will grow to abrawl anon.
PISTOL
     Die men like dogs! give crowns like pins! Have we
     not Heren here?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O' my word, captain, there's none such here. What
     the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For
     God's sake, be quiet.
PISTOL
     Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis.
     Come, give's some sack.
     'Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento.'
     Fear we broadsides? no, let the fiend give fire:
     Give me some sack: and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
     Laying down his sword
     Come we to full points here; and are etceteras nothing?
FALSTAFF
     Pistol, I would be quiet.
PISTOL
     Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf: what! we have seen
     the seven stars.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     For God's sake, thrust him down stairs: I cannot
     endure such a fustian rascal.
PISTOL
     Thrust him down stairs! know we not Galloway nags?
FALSTAFF
     Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat
     shilling: nay, an a' do nothing but speak nothing,
     a' shall be nothing here.
BARDOLPH
     Come, get you down stairs.
PISTOL
     What! shall we have incision? shall we imbrue?
     Snatching up his sword
     Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days!
     Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds
     Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Here's goodly stuff toward!
FALSTAFF
     Give me my rapier, boy.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.
FALSTAFF
     Get you down stairs.
     Drawing, and driving PISTOL out
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping
     house, afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights.
     So; murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas! put up
     your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.
     Exeunt PISTOL and BARDOLPH
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone.
     Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     He you not hurt i' the groin? methought a' made a
     shrewd thrust at your belly.
     Re-enter BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF
     Have you turned him out o' doors?
BARDOLPH
     Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk: you have hurt him,
     sir, i' the shoulder.
FALSTAFF
     A rascal! to brave me!
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! alas, poor ape,
     how thou sweatest! come, let me wipe thy face;
     come on, you whoreson chops: ah, rogue! i'faith, I
     love thee: thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,
     worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than
     the Nine Worthies: ah, villain!
FALSTAFF
     A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost,
     I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.
     Enter Music
Page
     The music is come, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll.
     A rascal bragging slave! the rogue fled from me
     like quicksilver.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I' faith, and thou followedst him like a church.
     Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig,
     when wilt thou leave fighting o' days and foining
     o' nights, and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?
     Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS, disguised
FALSTAFF
     Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;
     do not bid me remember mine end.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Sirrah, what humour's the prince of?
FALSTAFF
     A good shallow young fellow: a' would have made a
     good pantler, a' would ha' chipp'd bread well.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     They say Poins has a good wit.
FALSTAFF
     He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thick
     as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him
     than is in a mallet.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Why does the prince love him so, then?
FALSTAFF
     Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'
     plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,
     and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and
     rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon
     joined-stools, and swears with a good grace, and
     wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of
     the leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet
     stories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,
     that show a weak mind and an able body, for the
     which the prince admits him: for the prince himself
     is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the
     scales between their avoirdupois.
PRINCE HENRY
     Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
POINS
     Let's beat him before his whore.
PRINCE HENRY
     Look, whether the withered elder hath not his poll
     clawed like a parrot.
POINS
     Is it not strange that desire should so many years
     outlive performance?
FALSTAFF
     Kiss me, Doll.
PRINCE HENRY
     Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! what
     says the almanac to that?
POINS
     And look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not
     lisping to his master's old tables, his note-book,
     his counsel-keeper.
FALSTAFF
     Thou dost give me flattering busses.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.
FALSTAFF
     I am old, I am old.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young
     boy of them all.
FALSTAFF
     What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive
     money o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. A
     merry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed.
     Thou'lt forget me when I am gone.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thou
     sayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsome
     till thy return: well, harken at the end.
FALSTAFF
     Some sack, Francis.
PRINCE HENRY POINS
     Anon, anon, sir.
     Coming forward
FALSTAFF
     Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not thou
     Poins his brother?
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, thou globe of sinful continents! what a life
     dost thou lead!
FALSTAFF
     A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou art a drawer.
PRINCE HENRY
     Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,
     welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet
     face of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?
FALSTAFF
     Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light
     flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     How, you fat fool! I scorn you.
POINS
     My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and
     turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.
PRINCE HENRY
     You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you
     speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,
     civil gentlewoman!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,
     by my troth.
FALSTAFF
     Didst thou hear me?
PRINCE HENRY
     Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away
     by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and
     spoke it on purpose to try my patience.
FALSTAFF
     No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.
PRINCE HENRY
     I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;
     and then I know how to handle you.
FALSTAFF
     No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.
PRINCE HENRY
     Not to dispraise me, and call me pantier and
     bread-chipper and I know not what?
FALSTAFF
     No abuse, Hal.
POINS
     No abuse?
FALSTAFF
     No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I
     dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked
     might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I
     have done the part of a careful friend and a true
     subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.
     No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.
PRINCE HENRY
     See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth
     not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to
     close with us? is she of the wicked? is thine
     hostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of the
     wicked? or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his
     nose, of the wicked?
POINS
     Answer, thou dead elm, answer.
FALSTAFF
     The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;
     and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he
     doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy,
     there is a good angel about him; but the devil
     outbids him too.
PRINCE HENRY
     For the women?
FALSTAFF
     For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns
     poor souls. For the other, I owe her money, and
     whether she be damned for that, I know not.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     No, I warrant you.
FALSTAFF
     No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for
     that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,
     for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,
     contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton or
     two in a whole Lent?
PRINCE HENRY
     You, gentlewoman,-
DOLL TEARSHEET
     What says your grace?
FALSTAFF
     His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.
     Knocking within
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there, Francis.
     Enter PETO
PRINCE HENRY
     Peto, how now! what news?
PETO
     The king your father is at Westminster:
     And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
     Come from the north: and, as I came along,
     I met and overtook a dozen captains,
     Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,
     And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.
PRINCE HENRY
     By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,
     So idly to profane the precious time,
     When tempest of commotion, like the south
     Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
     And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
     Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.
     Exeunt PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF
     Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and
     we must hence and leave it unpicked.
     Knocking within
     More knocking at the door!
     Re-enter BARDOLPH
     How now! what's the matter?
BARDOLPH
     You must away to court, sir, presently;
     A dozen captains stay at door for you.
FALSTAFF
     [To the Page] Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,
     hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches,
     how men of merit are sought after: the undeserver
     may sleep, when the man of action is called on.
     Farewell good wenches: if I be not sent away post,
     I will see you again ere I go.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I cannot speak; if my heart be not read to burst,--
     well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.
FALSTAFF
     Farewell, farewell.
     Exeunt FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Well, fare thee well: I have known thee these
     twenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but an
     honester and truer-hearted man,--well, fare thee well.
BARDOLPH
     [Within] Mistress Tearsheet!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     What's the matter?
BARDOLPH
     [Within] Good Mistress Tearsheet, come to my master.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O, run, Doll, run; run, good Doll: come.
     She comes blubbered
     Yea, will you come, Doll?
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. Westminster. The palace. ****
     Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown, with a Page
KING HENRY IV
     Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
     But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,
     And well consider of them; make good speed.
     Exit Page
     How many thousand of my poorest subjects
     Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
     Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
     That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
     And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
     Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
     Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
     And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
     Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
     Under the canopies of costly state,
     And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
     O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
     In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
     A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?
     Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
     Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
     In cradle of the rude imperious surge
     And in the visitation of the winds,
     Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
     Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
     With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,
     That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?
     Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
     To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
     And in the calmest and most stillest night,
     With all appliances and means to boot,
     Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!
     Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
     Enter WARWICK and SURREY
WARWICK
     Many good morrows to your majesty!
KING HENRY IV
     Is it good morrow, lords?
WARWICK
     'Tis one o'clock, and past.
KING HENRY IV
     Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.
     Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?
WARWICK
     We have, my liege.
KING HENRY IV
     Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
     How foul it is; what rank diseases grow
     And with what danger, near the heart of it.
WARWICK
     It is but as a body yet distemper'd;
     Which to his former strength may be restored
     With good advice and little medicine:
     My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.
KING HENRY IV
     O God! that one might read the book of fate,
     And see the revolution of the times
     Make mountains level, and the continent,
     Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
     Into the sea! and, other times, to see
     The beachy girdle of the ocean
     Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,
     And changes fill the cup of alteration
     With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
     The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
     What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
     Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
     'Tis not 'ten years gone
     Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
     Did feast together, and in two years after
     Were they at wars: it is but eight years since
     This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
     Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
     And laid his love and life under my foot,
     Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
     Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--
     You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--
     To WARWICK
     When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
     Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,
     Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?
     'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
     My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'
     Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
     But that necessity so bow'd the state
     That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:
     'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,
     'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
     Shall break into corruption:' so went on,
     Foretelling this same time's condition
     And the division of our amity.
WARWICK
     There is a history in all men's lives,
     Figuring the nature of the times deceased;
     The which observed, a man may prophesy,
     With a near aim, of the main chance of things
     As yet not come to life, which in their seeds
     And weak beginnings lie intreasured.
     Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
     And by the necessary form of this
     King Richard might create a perfect guess
     That great Northumberland, then false to him,
     Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;
     Which should not find a ground to root upon,
     Unless on you.
KING HENRY IV
     Are these things then necessities?
     Then let us meet them like necessities:
     And that same word even now cries out on us:
     They say the bishop and Northumberland
     Are fifty thousand strong.
WARWICK
     It cannot be, my lord;
     Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
     The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace
     To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,
     The powers that you already have sent forth
     Shall bring this prize in very easily.
     To comfort you the more, I have received
     A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
     Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,
     And these unseason'd hours perforce must add
     Unto your sickness.
KING HENRY IV
     I will take your counsel:
     And were these inward wars once out of hand,
     We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Gloucestershire. Before SHALLOW'S house. ****
     Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY, SHADOW, WART, FEEBLE,
     BULLCALF, a Servant or two with them
SHALLOW
     Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,
     sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by
     the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?
SILENCE
     Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
SHALLOW
     And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your
     fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?
SILENCE
     Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!
SHALLOW
     By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is
     become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?
SILENCE
     Indeed, sir, to my cost.
SHALLOW
     A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was
     once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will
     talk of mad Shallow yet.
SILENCE
     You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.
SHALLOW
     By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would
     have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.
     There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,
     and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and
     Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such
     swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and
     I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were
     and had the best of them all at commandment. Then
     was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to
     Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
SILENCE
     This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
SHALLOW
     The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break
     Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a
     crack not thus high: and the very same day did I
     fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,
     behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I
     have spent! and to see how many of my old
     acquaintance are dead!
SILENCE
     We shall all follow, cousin.
SHADOW
     Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,
     as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall
     die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?
SILENCE
     By my troth, I was not there.
SHALLOW
     Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living
     yet?
SILENCE
     Dead, sir.
SHALLOW
     Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'
     shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and
     betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have
     clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried
     you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a
     half, that it would have done a man's heart good to
     see. How a score of ewes now?
SILENCE
     Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be
     worth ten pounds.
SHALLOW
     And is old Double dead?
SILENCE
     Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.
     Enter BARDOLPH and one with him
BARDOLPH
     Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which
     is Justice Shallow?
SHALLOW
     I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this
     county, and one of the king's justices of th e peace:
     What is your good pleasure with me?
BARDOLPH
     My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,
     Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and
     a most gallant leader.
SHALLOW
     He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword
     man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my
     lady his wife doth?
BARDOLPH
     Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than
     with a wife.
SHALLOW
     It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said
     indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,
     indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever
     were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of
     'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.
BARDOLPH
     Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call
     you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;
     but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a
     soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good
     command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a
     man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,
     being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;
     which is an excellent thing.
SHALLOW
     It is very just.
     Enter FALSTAFF
     Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good
     hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my
     troth, you like well and bear your years very well:
     welcome, good Sir John.
FALSTAFF
     I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert
     Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?
SHALLOW
     No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.
FALSTAFF
     Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of
     the peace.
SILENCE
     Your good-worship is welcome.
FALSTAFF
     Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you
     provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
SHALLOW
     Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
FALSTAFF
     Let me see them, I beseech you.
SHALLOW
     Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the
     roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:
     yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as
     I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me
     see; where is Mouldy?
MOULDY
     Here, an't please you.
SHALLOW
     What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;
     young, strong, and of good friends.
FALSTAFF
     Is thy name Mouldy?
MOULDY
     Yea, an't please you.
FALSTAFF
     'Tis the more time thou wert used.
SHALLOW
     Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that
     are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,
     well said, Sir John, very well said.
FALSTAFF
     Prick him.
MOULDY
     I was pricked well enough before, an you could have
     let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for
     one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need
     not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter
     to go out than I.
FALSTAFF
     Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is
     time you were spent.
MOULDY
     Spent!
SHALLOW
     Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where
     you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:
     Simon Shadow!
FALSTAFF
     Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like
     to be a cold soldier.
SHALLOW
     Where's Shadow?
SHADOW
     Here, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Shadow, whose son art thou?
SHADOW
     My mother's son, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's
     shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of
     the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the
     father's substance!
SHALLOW
     Do you like him, Sir John?
FALSTAFF
     Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have
     a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.
SHALLOW
     Thomas Wart!
FALSTAFF
     Where's he?
WART
     Here, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Is thy name Wart?
WART
     Yea, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Thou art a very ragged wart.
SHALLOW
     Shall I prick him down, Sir John?
FALSTAFF
     It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon
     his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:
     prick him no more.
SHALLOW
     Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I
     commend you well. Francis Feeble!
FEEBLE
     Here, sir.
FALSTAFF
     What trade art thou, Feeble?
FEEBLE
     A woman's tailor, sir.
SHALLOW
     Shall I prick him, sir?
FALSTAFF
     You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld
     ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in
     an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
FEEBLE
     I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
FALSTAFF
     Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,
     courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the
     wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the
     woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.
FEEBLE
     I would Wart might have gone, sir.
FALSTAFF
     I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst
     mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him
     to a private soldier that is the leader of so many
     thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
FEEBLE
     It shall suffice, sir.
FALSTAFF
     I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?
SHALLOW
     Peter Bullcalf o' the green!
FALSTAFF
     Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.
BULLCALF
     Here, sir.
FALSTAFF
     'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf
     till he roar again.
BULLCALF
     O Lord! good my lord captain,--
FALSTAFF
     What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?
BULLCALF
     O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.
FALSTAFF
     What disease hast thou?
BULLCALF
     A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught
     with ringing in the king's affairs upon his
     coronation-day, sir.
FALSTAFF
     Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt
     have away thy cold; and I will take such order that
     my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?
SHALLOW
     Here is two more called than your number, you must
     have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in
     with me to dinner.
FALSTAFF
     Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry
     dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
     O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night
     in the windmill in Saint George's field?
FALSTAFF
     No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.
SHALLOW
     Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
FALSTAFF
     She lives, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
     She never could away with me.
FALSTAFF
     Never, never; she would always say she could not
     abide Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
     By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She
     was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
FALSTAFF
     Old, old, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
     Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
     certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old
     Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.
SILENCE
     That's fifty-five year ago.
SHALLOW
     Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that
     this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
FALSTAFF
     We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
     That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
     Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'
     Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:
     Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.
     Exeunt FALSTAFF and Justices
BULLCALF
     Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;
     and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns
     for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be
     hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,
     I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,
     and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with
     my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own
     part, so much.
BARDOLPH
     Go to; stand aside.
MOULDY
     And, good master corporal captain, for my old
     dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do
     any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,
     and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.
BARDOLPH
     Go to; stand aside.
FEEBLE
     By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we
     owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:
     an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is
     too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way
     it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
BARDOLPH
     Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.
FEEBLE
     Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
     Re-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices
FALSTAFF
     Come, sir, which men shall I have?
SHALLOW
     Four of which you please.
BARDOLPH
     Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free
     Mouldy and Bullcalf.
FALSTAFF
     Go to; well.
SHALLOW
     Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
FALSTAFF
     Do you choose for me.
SHALLOW
     Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.
FALSTAFF
     Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home
     till you are past service: and for your part,
     Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.
SHALLOW
     Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are
     your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
FALSTAFF
     Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a
     man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,
     bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the
     spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a
     ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and
     discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's
     hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets
     on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced
     fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
     mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
     level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;
     how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run
     off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the
     great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.
BARDOLPH
     Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.
FALSTAFF
     Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go
     to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a
     little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'
     faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a
     tester for thee.
SHALLOW
     He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
     right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at
     Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
     show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'
     would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
     and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,
     tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and
     away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I
     shall ne'er see such a fellow.
FALSTAFF
     These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God
     keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words
     with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank
     you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give
     the soldiers coats.
SHALLOW
     Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your
     affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit
     our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;
     peradventure I will with ye to the court.
FALSTAFF
     'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW
     Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
FALSTAFF
     Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.
     Exeunt Justices
     On, Bardolph; lead the men away.
     Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, & c
     As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do
     see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how
     subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This
     same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
     me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he
     hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
     word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's
     tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a
     man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'
     was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
     radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
     with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his
     dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'
     was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a
     monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came
     ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those
     tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
     carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or
     his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger
     become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a
     Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
     I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the
     Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
     among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a
     Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
     thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
     case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
     court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll
     be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
     go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two
     stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
     old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
     may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest. ****
     Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, LORD HASTINGS, and others
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     What is this forest call'd?
HASTINGS
     'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth
     To know the numbers of our enemies.
HASTINGS
     We have sent forth already.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     'Tis well done.
     My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
     I must acquaint you that I have received
     New-dated letters from Northumberland;
     Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:
     Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
     As might hold sortance with his quality,
     The which he could not levy; whereupon
     He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,
     To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers
     That your attempts may overlive the hazard
     And fearful melting of their opposite.
MOWBRAY
     Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
     And dash themselves to pieces.
     Enter a Messenger
HASTINGS
     Now, what news?
Messenger
     West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
     In goodly form comes on the enemy;
     And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
     Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
MOWBRAY
     The just proportion that we gave them out
     Let us sway on and face them in the field.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
     Enter WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY
     I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
WESTMORELAND
     Health and fair greeting from our general,
     The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:
     What doth concern your coming?
WESTMORELAND
     Then, my lord,
     Unto your grace do I in chief address
     The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
     Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
     Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
     And countenanced by boys and beggary,
     I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,
     In his true, native and most proper shape,
     You, reverend father, and these noble lords
     Had not been here, to dress the ugly form
     Of base and bloody insurrection
     With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
     Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
     Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
     Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
     Whose white investments figure innocence,
     The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
     Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
     Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
     Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
     Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
     Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
     To a trumpet and a point of war?
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
     Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
     And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
     Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
     And we must bleed for it; of which disease
     Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
     But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
     I take not on me here as a physician,
     Nor do I as an enemy to peace
     Troop in the throngs of military men;
     But rather show awhile like fearful war,
     To diet rank minds sick of happiness
     And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
     Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
     I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
     What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
     And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
     We see which way the stream of time doth run,
     And are enforced from our most quiet there
     By the rough torrent of occasion;
     And have the summary of all our griefs,
     When time shall serve, to show in articles;
     Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
     And might by no suit gain our audience:
     When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
     We are denied access unto his person
     Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
     The dangers of the days but newly gone,
     Whose memory is written on the earth
     With yet appearing blood, and the examples
     Of every minute's instance, present now,
     Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
     Not to break peace or any branch of it,
     But to establish here a peace indeed,
     Concurring both in name and quality.
WESTMORELAND
     When ever yet was your appeal denied?
     Wherein have you been galled by the king?
     What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,
     That you should seal this lawless bloody book
     Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
     And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     My brother general, the commonwealth,
     To brother born an household cruelty,
     I make my quarrel in particular.
WESTMORELAND
     There is no need of any such redress;
     Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
MOWBRAY
     Why not to him in part, and to us all
     That feel the bruises of the days before,
     And suffer the condition of these times
     To lay a heavy and unequal hand
     Upon our honours?
WESTMORELAND
     O, my good Lord Mowbray,
     Construe the times to their necessities,
     And you shall say indeed, it is the time,
     And not the king, that doth you injuries.
     Yet for your part, it not appears to me
     Either from the king or in the present time
     That you should have an inch of any ground
     To build a grief on: were you not restored
     To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,
     Your noble and right well remember'd father's?
MOWBRAY
     What thing, in honour, had my father lost,
     That need to be revived and breathed in me?
     The king that loved him, as the state stood then,
     Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
     And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,
     Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
     Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
     Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
     Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
     And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
     Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
     My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
     O when the king did throw his warder down,
     His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
     Then threw he down himself and all their lives
     That by indictment and by dint of sword
     Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
WESTMORELAND
     You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
     The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
     In England the most valiant gentlemen:
     Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
     But if your father had been victor there,
     He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:
     For all the country in a general voice
     Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
     Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
     And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.
     But this is mere digression from my purpose.
     Here come I from our princely general
     To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
     That he will give you audience; and wherein
     It shall appear that your demands are just,
     You shall enjoy them, every thing set off
     That might so much as think you enemies.
MOWBRAY
     But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
     And it proceeds from policy, not love.
WESTMORELAND
     Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
     This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:
     For, lo! within a ken our army lies,
     Upon mine honour, all too confident
     To give admittance to a thought of fear.
     Our battle is more full of names than yours,
     Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
     Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
     Then reason will our heart should be as good
     Say you not then our offer is compell'd.
MOWBRAY
     Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
WESTMORELAND
     That argues but the shame of your offence:
     A rotten case abides no handling.
HASTINGS
     Hath the Prince John a full commission,
     In very ample virtue of his father,
     To hear and absolutely to determine
     Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
WESTMORELAND
     That is intended in the general's name:
     I muse you make so slight a question.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
     For this contains our general grievances:
     Each several article herein redress'd,
     All members of our cause, both here and hence,
     That are insinew'd to this action,
     Acquitted by a true substantial form
     And present execution of our wills
     To us and to our purposes confined,
     We come within our awful banks again
     And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
WESTMORELAND
     This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
     In sight of both our battles we may meet;
     And either end in peace, which God so frame!
     Or to the place of difference call the swords
     Which must decide it.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     My lord, we will do so.
     Exit WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY
     There is a thing within my bosom tells me
     That no conditions of our peace can stand.
HASTINGS
     Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
     Upon such large terms and so absolute
     As our conditions shall consist upon,
     Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
MOWBRAY
     Yea, but our valuation shall be such
     That every slight and false-derived cause,
     Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason
     Shall to the king taste of this action;
     That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
     We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
     That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
     And good from bad find no partition.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary
     Of dainty and such picking grievances:
     For he hath found to end one doubt by death
     Revives two greater in the heirs of life,
     And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
     And keep no tell-tale to his memory
     That may repeat and history his loss
     To new remembrance; for full well he knows
     He cannot so precisely weed this land
     As his misdoubts present occasion:
     His foes are so enrooted with his friends
     That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
     He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:
     So that this land, like an offensive wife
     That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,
     As he is striking, holds his infant up
     And hangs resolved correction in the arm
     That was uprear'd to execution.
HASTINGS
     Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods
     On late offenders, that he now doth lack
     The very instruments of chastisement:
     So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
     May offer, but not hold.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     'Tis very true:
     And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,
     If we do now make our atonement well,
     Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
     Grow stronger for the breaking.
MOWBRAY
     Be it so.
     Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.
     Re-enter WESTMORELAND
WESTMORELAND
     The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship
     To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.
MOWBRAY
     Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Another part of the forest. ****
     Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards the ARCHBISHOP OF
     YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from the other side, Prince John of
     LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them
LANCASTER
     You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:
     Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;
     And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
     My Lord of York, it better show'd with you
     When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
     Encircled you to hear with reverence
     Your exposition on the holy text
     Than now to see you here an iron man,
     Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
     Turning the word to sword and life to death.
     That man that sits within a monarch's heart,
     And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
     Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
     Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch
     In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,
     It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
     How deep you were within the books of God?
     To us the speaker in his parliament;
     To us the imagined voice of God himself;
     The very opener and intelligencer
     Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
     And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
     But you misuse the reverence of your place,
     Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,
     As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
     In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,
     Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
     The subjects of his substitute, my father,
     And both against the peace of heaven and him
     Have here up-swarm'd them.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Good my Lord of Lancaster,
     I am not here against your father's peace;
     But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,
     The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,
     Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
     To hold our safety up. I sent your grace
     The parcels and particulars of our grief,
     The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,
     Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
     Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
     With grant of our most just and right desires,
     And true obedience, of this madness cured,
     Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
MOWBRAY
     If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
     To the last man.
HASTINGS
     And though we here fall down,
     We have supplies to second our attempt:
     If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
     And so success of mischief shall be born
     And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
     Whiles England shall have generation.
LANCASTER
     You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,
     To sound the bottom of the after-times.
WESTMORELAND
     Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
     How far forth you do like their articles.
LANCASTER
     I like them all, and do allow them well,
     And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
     My father's purposes have been mistook,
     And some about him have too lavishly
     Wrested his meaning and authority.
     My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
     Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
     Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
     As we will ours: and here between the armies
     Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
     That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
     Of our restored love and amity.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     I take your princely word for these redresses.
LANCASTER
     I give it you, and will maintain my word:
     And thereupon I drink unto your grace.
HASTINGS
     Go, captain, and deliver to the army
     This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:
     I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.
     Exit Officer
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
WESTMORELAND
     I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains
     I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,
     You would drink freely: but my love to ye
     Shall show itself more openly hereafter.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     I do not doubt you.
WESTMORELAND
     I am glad of it.
     Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.
MOWBRAY
     You wish me health in very happy season;
     For I am, on the sudden, something ill.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Against ill chances men are ever merry;
     But heaviness foreruns the good event.
WESTMORELAND
     Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
     Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes
     to-morrow.'
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
MOWBRAY
     So much the worse, if your own rule be true.
     Shouts within
LANCASTER
     The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!
MOWBRAY
     This had been cheerful after victory.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
     For then both parties nobly are subdued,
     And neither party loser.
LANCASTER
     Go, my lord,
     And let our army be discharged too.
     Exit WESTMORELAND
     And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains
     March, by us, that we may peruse the men
     We should have coped withal.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Go, good Lord Hastings,
     And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.
     Exit HASTINGS
LANCASTER
     I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.
     Re-enter WESTMORELAND
     Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?
WESTMORELAND
     The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
     Will not go off until they hear you speak.
LANCASTER
     They know their duties.
     Re-enter HASTINGS
HASTINGS
     My lord, our army is dispersed already;
     Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses
     East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,
     Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
WESTMORELAND
     Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
     I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:
     And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
     Of capitol treason I attach you both.
MOWBRAY
     Is this proceeding just and honourable?
WESTMORELAND
     Is your assembly so?
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Will you thus break your faith?
LANCASTER
     I pawn'd thee none:
     I promised you redress of these same grievances
     Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,
     I will perform with a most Christian care.
     But for you, rebels, look to taste the due
     Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
     Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
     Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
     Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:
     God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.
     Some guard these traitors to the block of death,
     Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Another part of the forest. ****
     Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting
FALSTAFF
     What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,
     and of what place, I pray?
COLEVILE
     I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.
FALSTAFF
     Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your
     degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be
     still your name, a traitor your degree, and the
     dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall
     you be still Colevile of the dale.
COLEVILE
     Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
FALSTAFF
     As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye
     yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do
     sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they
     weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
     trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
COLEVILE
     I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
     thought yield me.
FALSTAFF
     I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
     mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other
     word but my name. An I had but a belly of any
     indifference, I were simply the most active fellow
     in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.
     Here comes our general.
     Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others
LANCASTER
     The heat is past; follow no further now:
     Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.
     Exit WESTMORELAND
     Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
     When every thing is ended, then you come:
     These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,
     One time or other break some gallows' back.
FALSTAFF
     I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I
     never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward
     of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a
     bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the
     expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
     the very extremest inch of possibility; I have
     foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,
     travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and
     immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the
     dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.
     But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I
     may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,
     'I came, saw, and overcame.'
LANCASTER
     It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
FALSTAFF
     I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and
     I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the
     rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will
     have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own
     picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:
     to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not
     all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the
     clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
     moon doth the cinders of the element, which show
     like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of
     the noble: therefore let me have right, and let
     desert mount.
LANCASTER
     Thine's too heavy to mount.
FALSTAFF
     Let it shine, then.
LANCASTER
     Thine's too thick to shine.
FALSTAFF
     Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me
     good, and call it what you will.
LANCASTER
     Is thy name Colevile?
COLEVILE
     It is, my lord.
LANCASTER
     A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.
FALSTAFF
     And a famous true subject took him.
COLEVILE
     I am, my lord, but as my betters are
     That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,
     You should have won them dearer than you have.
FALSTAFF
     I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like
     a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I
     thank thee for thee.
     Re-enter WESTMORELAND
LANCASTER
     Now, have you left pursuit?
WESTMORELAND
     Retreat is made and execution stay'd.
LANCASTER
     Send Colevile with his confederates
     To York, to present execution:
     Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.
     Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE
     And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:
     I hear the king my father is sore sick:
     Our news shall go before us to his majesty,
     Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,
     And we with sober speed will follow you.
FALSTAFF
     My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go
     Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,
     Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.
LANCASTER
     Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,
     Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
     Exeunt all but Falstaff
FALSTAFF
     I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than
     your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-
     blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
     him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.
     There's never none of these demure boys come to any
     proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
     and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a
     kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
     marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
     and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
     inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
     operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
     dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
     vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
     quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
     delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the
     voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
     excellent wit. The second property of your
     excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;
     which, before cold and settled, left the liver
     white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
     and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
     it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
     it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
     warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
     man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
     inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
     the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
     retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
     comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
     nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
     learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
     sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
     Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
     the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
     father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
     manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
     endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
     sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
     I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
     would teach them should be, to forswear thin
     potations and to addict themselves to sack.
     Enter BARDOLPH
     How now Bardolph?
BARDOLPH
     The army is discharged all and gone.
FALSTAFF
     Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and
     there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:
     I have him already tempering between my finger and
     my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber. ****
     Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE and Humphrey of
     GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others
KING HENRY IV
     Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
     To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
     We will our youth lead on to higher fields
     And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
     Our navy is address'd, our power collected,
     Our substitutes in absence well invested,
     And every thing lies level to our wish:
     Only, we want a little personal strength;
     And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,
     Come underneath the yoke of government.
WARWICK
     Both which we doubt not but your majesty
     Shall soon enjoy.
KING HENRY IV
     Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
     Where is the prince your brother?
GLOUCESTER
     I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
KING HENRY IV
     And how accompanied?
GLOUCESTER
     I do not know, my lord.
KING HENRY IV
     Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?
GLOUCESTER
     No, my good lord; he is in presence here.
CLARENCE
     What would my lord and father?
KING HENRY IV
     Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
     How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
     He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
     Thou hast a better place in his affection
     Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
     And noble offices thou mayst effect
     Of mediation, after I am dead,
     Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
     Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
     Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
     By seeming cold or careless of his will;
     For he is gracious, if he be observed:
     He hath a tear for pity and a hand
     Open as day for melting charity:
     Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,
     As humorous as winter and as sudden
     As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
     His temper, therefore, must be well observed:
     Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
     When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
     But, being moody, give him line and scope,
     Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
     Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
     And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
     A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
     That the united vessel of their blood,
     Mingled with venom of suggestion--
     As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--
     Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
     As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
CLARENCE
     I shall observe him with all care and love.
KING HENRY IV
     Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
CLARENCE
     He is not there to-day; he dines in London.
KING HENRY IV
     And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?
CLARENCE
     With Poins, and other his continual followers.
KING HENRY IV
     Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
     And he, the noble image of my youth,
     Is overspread with them: therefore my grief
     Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:
     The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
     In forms imaginary the unguided days
     And rotten times that you shall look upon
     When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
     For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
     When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
     When means and lavish manners meet together,
     O, with what wings shall his affections fly
     Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!
WARWICK
     My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:
     The prince but studies his companions
     Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
     'Tis needful that the most immodest word
     Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,
     Your highness knows, comes to no further use
     But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
     The prince will in the perfectness of time
     Cast off his followers; and their memory
     Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
     By which his grace must mete the lives of others,
     Turning past evils to advantages.
KING HENRY IV
     'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
     In the dead carrion.
     Enter WESTMORELAND
     Who's here? Westmoreland?
WESTMORELAND
     Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
     Added to that that I am to deliver!
     Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:
     Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all
     Are brought to the correction of your law;
     There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
     But peace puts forth her olive every where.
     The manner how this action hath been borne
     Here at more leisure may your highness read,
     With every course in his particular.
KING HENRY IV
     O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
     Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
     The lifting up of day.
     Enter HARCOURT
     Look, here's more news.
HARCOURT
     From enemies heaven keep your majesty;
     And, when they stand against you, may they fall
     As those that I am come to tell you of!
     The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
     With a great power of English and of Scots
     Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:
     The manner and true order of the fight
     This packet, please it you, contains at large.
KING HENRY IV
     And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
     Will fortune never come with both hands full,
     But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
     She either gives a stomach and no food;
     Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast
     And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,
     That have abundance and enjoy it not.
     I should rejoice now at this happy news;
     And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:
     O me! come near me; now I am much ill.
GLOUCESTER
     Comfort, your majesty!
CLARENCE
     O my royal father!
WESTMORELAND
     My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
WARWICK
     Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits
     Are with his highness very ordinary.
     Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.
CLARENCE
     No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:
     The incessant care and labour of his mind
     Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
     So thin that life looks through and will break out.
GLOUCESTER
     The people fear me; for they do observe
     Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:
     The seasons change their manners, as the year
     Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.
CLARENCE
     The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;
     And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,
     Say it did so a little time before
     That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.
WARWICK
     Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.
GLOUCESTER
     This apoplexy will certain be his end.
KING HENRY IV
     I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence
     Into some other chamber: softly, pray.
**** SCENE V. Another chamber. ****
     KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and
     others in attendance
KING HENRY IV
     Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;
     Unless some dull and favourable hand
     Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
WARWICK
     Call for the music in the other room.
KING HENRY IV
     Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
CLARENCE
     His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
WARWICK
     Less noise, less noise!
     Enter PRINCE HENRY
PRINCE HENRY
     Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
CLARENCE
     I am here, brother, full of heaviness.
PRINCE HENRY
     How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!
     How doth the king?
GLOUCESTER
     Exceeding ill.
PRINCE HENRY
     Heard he the good news yet?
     Tell it him.
GLOUCESTER
     He alter'd much upon the hearing it.
PRINCE HENRY
     If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.
WARWICK
     Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,
     speak low;
     The king your father is disposed to sleep.
CLARENCE
     Let us withdraw into the other room.
WARWICK
     Will't please your grace to go along with us?
PRINCE HENRY
     No; I will sit and watch here by the king.
     Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY
     Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
     Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
     O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
     That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
     To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!
     Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
     As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
     Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
     When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
     Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,
     That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath
     There lies a downy feather which stirs not:
     Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
     Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!
     This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep
     That from this golden rigol hath divorced
     So many English kings. Thy due from me
     Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
     Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
     Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:
     My due from thee is this imperial crown,
     Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,
     Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,
     Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength
     Into one giant arm, it shall not force
     This lineal honour from me: this from thee
     Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.

KING HENRY IV
     Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!
     Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest
CLARENCE
     Doth the king call?
WARWICK
     What would your majesty? How fares your grace?
KING HENRY IV
     Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?
CLARENCE
     We left the prince my brother here, my liege,
     Who undertook to sit and watch by you.
KING HENRY IV
     The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:
     He is not here.
WARWICK
     This door is open; he is gone this way.
GLOUCESTER
     He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
KING HENRY IV
     Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?
WARWICK
     When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
KING HENRY IV
     The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.
     Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
     My sleep my death?
     Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.
     Exit WARWICK
     This part of his conjoins with my disease,
     And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
     How quickly nature falls into revolt
     When gold becomes her object!
     For this the foolish over-careful fathers
     Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,
     Their bones with industry;
     For this they have engrossed and piled up
     The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;
     For this they have been thoughtful to invest
     Their sons with arts and martial exercises:
     When, like the bee, culling from every flower
     The virtuous sweets,
     Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,
     We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,
     Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste
     Yield his engrossments to the ending father.
     Re-enter WARWICK
     Now, where is he that will not stay so long
     Till his friend sickness hath determined me?
WARWICK
     My lord, I found the prince in the next room,
     Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
     With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
     That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,
     Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife
     With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.
KING HENRY IV
     But wherefore did he take away the crown?
     Re-enter PRINCE HENRY
     Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.
     Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.
     Exeunt WARWICK and the rest
PRINCE HENRY
     I never thought to hear you speak again.
KING HENRY IV
     Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
     I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
     Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
     That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
     Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
     Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.
     Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
     Is held from falling with so weak a wind
     That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
     Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
     Were thine without offence; and at my death
     Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
     Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,
     And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
     Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
     Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
     To stab at half an hour of my life.
     What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
     Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
     And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
     That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
     Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
     Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
     Only compound me with forgotten dust
     Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
     Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
     For now a time is come to mock at form:
     Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!
     Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
     And to the English court assemble now,
     From every region, apes of idleness!
     Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
     Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
     Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
     The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
     Be happy, he will trouble you no more;
     England shall double gild his treble guilt,
     England shall give him office, honour, might;
     For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
     The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
     Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
     O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
     When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
     What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
     O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
     Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!
PRINCE HENRY
     O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,
     The moist impediments unto my speech,
     I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
     Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
     The course of it so far. There is your crown;
     And He that wears the crown immortally
     Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
     Than as your honour and as your renown,
     Let me no more from this obedience rise,
     Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
     Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
     God witness with me, when I here came in,
     And found no course of breath within your majesty,
     How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
     O, let me in my present wildness die
     And never live to show the incredulous world
     The noble change that I have purposed!
     Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
     And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
     I spake unto this crown as having sense,
     And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
     Hath fed upon the body of my father;
     Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
     Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
     Preserving life in medicine potable;
     But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,
     Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,
     Accusing it, I put it on my head,
     To try with it, as with an enemy
     That had before my face murder'd my father,
     The quarrel of a true inheritor.
     But if it did infect my blood with joy,
     Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
     If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
     Did with the least affection of a welcome
     Give entertainment to the might of it,
     Let God for ever keep it from my head
     And make me as the poorest vassal is
     That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
KING HENRY IV
     O my son,
     God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
     That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
     Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
     Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
     And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
     That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
     By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
     I met this crown; and I myself know well
     How troublesome it sat upon my head.
     To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,
     Better opinion, better confirmation;
     For all the soil of the achievement goes
     With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
     But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
     And I had many living to upbraid
     My gain of it by their assistances;
     Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
     Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
     Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
     For all my reign hath been but as a scene
     Acting that argument: and now my death
     Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,
     Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
     So thou the garland wear'st successively.
     Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
     Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
     And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
     Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
     By whose fell working I was first advanced
     And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
     To be again displaced: which to avoid,
     I cut them off; and had a purpose now
     To lead out many to the Holy Land,
     Lest rest and lying still might make them look
     Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
     Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
     With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
     May waste the memory of the former days.
     More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
     That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
     How I came by the crown, O God forgive;
     And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
PRINCE HENRY
     My gracious liege,
     You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
     Then plain and right must my possession be:
     Which I with more than with a common pain
     'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.
     Enter Lord John of LANCASTER
KING HENRY IV
     Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.
LANCASTER
     Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!
KING HENRY IV
     Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;
     But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
     From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight
     My worldly business makes a period.
     Where is my Lord of Warwick?
PRINCE HENRY
     My Lord of Warwick!
     Enter WARWICK, and others
KING HENRY IV
     Doth any name particular belong
     Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
WARWICK
     'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.
KING HENRY IV
     Laud be to God! even there my life must end.
     It hath been prophesied to me many years,
     I should not die but in Jerusalem;
     Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:
     But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;
     In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S house. ****
     Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page
SHALLOW
     By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.
     What, Davy, I say!
FALSTAFF
     You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
SHALLOW
     I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;
     excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse
     shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!
     Enter DAVY
DAVY
     Here, sir.
SHALLOW
     Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me
     see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,
     bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
DAVY
     Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:
     and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?
SHALLOW
     With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are
     there no young pigeons?
DAVY
     Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing
     and plough-irons.
SHALLOW
     Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
DAVY
     Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be
     had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's
     wages, about the sack he lost the other day at
     Hinckley fair?
SHALLOW
     A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple
     of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any
     pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.
DAVY
     Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
SHALLOW
     Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the
     court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men
     well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.
DAVY
     No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they
     have marvellous foul linen.
SHALLOW
     Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.
DAVY
     I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of
     Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.
SHALLOW
     There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:
     that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.
DAVY
     I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but
     yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some
     countenance at his friend's request. An honest
     man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave
     is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,
     this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in
     a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I
     have but a very little credit with your worship. The
     knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I
     beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.
SHALLOW
     Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.
     Exit DAVY
     Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off
     with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.
BARDOLPH
     I am glad to see your worship.
SHALLOW
     I thank thee with all my heart, kind
     Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.
     To the Page
     Come, Sir John.
FALSTAFF
     I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.
     Exit SHALLOW
     Bardolph, look to our horses.
     Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page
     If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four
     dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master
     Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the
     semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:
     they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like
     foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is
     turned into a justice-like serving-man: their
     spirits are so married in conjunction with the
     participation of society that they flock together in
     consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit
     to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the
     imputation of being near their master: if to his
     men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man
     could better command his servants. It is certain
     that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
     caught, as men take diseases, one of another:
     therefore let men take heed of their company. I
     will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
     keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing
     out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two
     actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,
     it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
     with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
     had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him
     laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!
SHALLOW
     [Within] Sir John!
FALSTAFF
     I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Westminster. The palace. ****
     Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting
WARWICK
     How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?
     Lord Chief-Justice How doth the king?
WARWICK
     Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.
     Lord Chief-Justice I hope, not dead.
WARWICK
     He's walk'd the way of nature;
     And to our purposes he lives no more.
     Lord Chief-Justice I would his majesty had call'd me with him:
     The service that I truly did his life
     Hath left me open to all injuries.
WARWICK
     Indeed I think the young king loves you not.
     Lord Chief-Justice I know he doth not, and do arm myself
     To welcome the condition of the time,
     Which cannot look more hideously upon me
     Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.
     Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND, and others
WARWICK
     Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:
     O that the living Harry had the temper
     Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!
     How many nobles then should hold their places
     That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
     Lord Chief-Justice O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!
LANCASTER
     Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.
GLOUCESTER CLARENCE
     Good morrow, cousin.
LANCASTER
     We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
WARWICK
     We do remember; but our argument
     Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
LANCASTER
     Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.
     Lord Chief-Justice Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
GLOUCESTER
     O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;
     And I dare swear you borrow not that face
     Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.
LANCASTER
     Though no man be assured what grace to find,
     You stand in coldest expectation:
     I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.
CLARENCE
     Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;
     Which swims against your stream of quality.
     Lord Chief-Justice Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,
     Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:
     And never shall you see that I will beg
     A ragged and forestall'd remission.
     If truth and upright innocency fail me,
     I'll to the king my master that is dead,
     And tell him who hath sent me after him.
WARWICK
     Here comes the prince.
     Enter KING HENRY V, attended
     Lord Chief-Justice Good morrow; and God save your majesty!
KING HENRY V
     This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
     Sits not so easy on me as you think.
     Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:
     This is the English, not the Turkish court;
     Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
     But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
     For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:
     Sorrow so royally in you appears
     That I will deeply put the fashion on
     And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;
     But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
     Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
     For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,
     I'll be your father and your brother too;
     Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:
     Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;
     But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears
     By number into hours of happiness.
Princes
     We hope no other from your majesty.
KING HENRY V
     You all look strangely on me: and you most;
     You are, I think, assured I love you not.
     Lord Chief-Justice I am assured, if I be measured rightly,
     Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
KING HENRY V
     No!
     How might a prince of my great hopes forget
     So great indignities you laid upon me?
     What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison
     The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
     May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?
     Lord Chief-Justice I then did use the person of your father;
     The image of his power lay then in me:
     And, in the administration of his law,
     Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
     Your highness pleased to forget my place,
     The majesty and power of law and justice,
     The image of the king whom I presented,
     And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
     Whereon, as an offender to your father,
     I gave bold way to my authority
     And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
     Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
     To have a son set your decrees at nought,
     To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
     To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
     That guards the peace and safety of your person;
     Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image
     And mock your workings in a second body.
     Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
     Be now the father and propose a son,
     Hear your own dignity so much profaned,
     See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
     Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
     And then imagine me taking your part
     And in your power soft silencing your son:
     After this cold considerance, sentence me;
     And, as you are a king, speak in your state
     What I have done that misbecame my place,
     My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
KING HENRY V
     You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;
     Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
     And I do wish your honours may increase,
     Till you do live to see a son of mine
     Offend you and obey you, as I did.
     So shall I live to speak my father's words:
     'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
     That dares do justice on my proper son;
     And not less happy, having such a son,
     That would deliver up his greatness so
     Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:
     For which, I do commit into your hand
     The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
     With this remembrance, that you use the same
     With the like bold, just and impartial spirit
     As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.
     You shall be as a father to my youth:
     My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
     And I will stoop and humble my intents
     To your well-practised wise directions.
     And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
     My father is gone wild into his grave,
     For in his tomb lie my affections;
     And with his spirit sadly I survive,
     To mock the expectation of the world,
     To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
     Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
     After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
     Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:
     Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
     Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
     And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
     Now call we our high court of parliament:
     And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
     That the great body of our state may go
     In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
     That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
     As things acquainted and familiar to us;
     In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
     Our coronation done, we will accite,
     As I before remember'd, all our state:
     And, God consigning to my good intents,
     No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
     God shorten Harry's happy life one day!

SHALLOW
     Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,
     we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing,
     with a dish of caraways, and so forth: come,
     cousin Silence: and then to bed.
FALSTAFF
     'Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.

FALSTAFF
     This Davy serves you for good uses; he is your

SHALLOW
     A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,
     Sir John: by the mass, I have drunk too much sack
     at supper: a good varlet. Now sit down, now sit
     down: come, cousin.

     Be merry, be merry.
FALSTAFF
     I did not think Master Silence had been a man of
     this mettle.
SILENCE
     Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.
     Re-enter DAVY
DAVY
     There's a dish of leather-coats for you.
     To BARDOLPH
SHALLOW
     Davy!
DAVY
     Your worship! I'll be with you straight.
     To BARDOLPH
     A cup of wine, sir?
SILENCE
     A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
     Singing
     And drink unto the leman mine;
     And a merry heart lives long-a.
FALSTAFF
     Well said, Master Silence.
SILENCE
     An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' the night.
FALSTAFF
     Health and long life to you, Master Silence.
SILENCE
     Fill the cup, and let it come;
     Singing
     I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom.
SHALLOW
     Honest Bardolph, welcome: if thou wantest any
     thing, and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart.
     Welcome, my little tiny thief.
     To the Page
     And welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master
     Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London.
DAVY
     I hove to see London once ere I die.
BARDOLPH
     An I might see you there, Davy,--
SHALLOW
     By the mass, you'll crack a quart together, ha!
     Will you not, Master Bardolph?
BARDOLPH
     Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.
SHALLOW
     By God's liggens, I thank thee: the knave will
     stick by thee, I can assure thee that. A' will not
     out; he is true bred.
BARDOLPH
     And I'll stick by him, sir.
SHALLOW
     Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing: be merry.
     Knocking within
     Look who's at door there, ho! who knocks?
     Exit DAVY
FALSTAFF
     Why, now you have done me right.
     To SILENCE, seeing him take off a bumper
SILENCE
     [Singing]
     Do me right,
     And dub me knight: Samingo.
     Is't not so?
FALSTAFF
     'Tis so.
SILENCE
     Is't so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.
     Re-enter DAVY
DAVY
     An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come
     from the court with news.
FALSTAFF
     From the court! let him come in.
     Enter PISTOL
     How now, Pistol!
PISTOL
     Sir John, God save you!
FALSTAFF
     What wind blew you hither, Pistol?
PISTOL
     Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet
     knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.
SILENCE
     By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.
PISTOL
     Puff!
     Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!
     Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,
     And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,
     And tidings do I bring and lucky joys
     And golden times and happy news of price.
FALSTAFF
     I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.
PISTOL
     A foutre for the world and worldlings base!
     I speak of Africa and golden joys.
FALSTAFF
     O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?
     Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.
SILENCE
     And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.
     Singing
PISTOL
     Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?
     And shall good news be baffled?
     Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.
SILENCE
     Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.
PISTOL
     Why then, lament therefore.
SHALLOW
     Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news
     from the court, I take it there's but two ways,
     either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,
     sir, under the king, in some authority.
PISTOL
     Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.
SHALLOW
     Under King Harry.
PISTOL
     Harry the Fourth? or Fifth?
SHALLOW
     Harry the Fourth.
PISTOL
     A foutre for thine office!
     Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;
     Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:
     When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like
     The bragging Spaniard.
FALSTAFF
     What, is the old king dead?
PISTOL
     As nail in door: the things I speak are just.
FALSTAFF
     Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert
     Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,
     'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.
BARDOLPH
     O joyful day!
     I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.
PISTOL
     What! I do bring good news.
FALSTAFF
     Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my
     Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's
     steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night.
     O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!
     Exit BARDOLPH
     Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise
     something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master
     Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let
     us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at
     my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my
     friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!
PISTOL
     Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also!
     'Where is the life that late I led?' say they:
     Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. A street. ****
     Enter Beadles, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might
     die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast
     drawn my shoulder out of joint.
First Beadle
     The constables have delivered her over to me; and
     she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant
     her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell
     thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an
     the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert
     better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou
     paper-faced villain.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make
     this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the
     fruit of her womb miscarry!
First Beadle
     If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;
     you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go
     with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol
     beat amongst you.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I
     will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you
     blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,
     if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.
First Beadle
     Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     O God, that right should thus overcome might!
     Well, of sufferance comes ease.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Goodman death, goodman bones!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
     Thou atomy, thou!
DOLL TEARSHEET
     Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.
First Beadle
     Very well.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. A public place near Westminster Abbey. ****
     Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes
First Groom
     More rushes, more rushes.
Second Groom
     The trumpets have sounded twice.
First Groom
     'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the
     coronation: dispatch, dispatch.
     Exeunt
     Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page
FALSTAFF
     Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will
     make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as
     a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he
     will give me.
PISTOL
     God bless thy lungs, good knight.
FALSTAFF
     Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had
     time to have made new liveries, I would have
     bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But
     'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this
     doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
SHALLOW
     It doth so.
FALSTAFF
     It shows my earnestness of affection,--
SHALLOW
     It doth so.
FALSTAFF
     My devotion,--
SHALLOW
     It doth, it doth, it doth.
FALSTAFF
     As it were, to ride day and night; and not to
     deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience
     to shift me,--
SHALLOW
     It is best, certain.
FALSTAFF
     But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with
     desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,
     putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there
     were nothing else to be done but to see him.
PISTOL
     'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'
     'tis all in every part.
SHALLOW
     'Tis so, indeed.
PISTOL
     My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,
     And make thee rage.
     Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,
     Is in base durance and contagious prison;
     Haled thither
     By most mechanical and dirty hand:
     Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell
     Alecto's snake,
     For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.
FALSTAFF
     I will deliver her.
     Shouts within, and the trumpets sound
PISTOL
     There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
     Enter KING HENRY V and his train, the Lord Chief- Justice among them
FALSTAFF
     God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!
PISTOL
     The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!
FALSTAFF
     God save thee, my sweet boy!
KING HENRY IV
     My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.
     Lord Chief-Justice Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?
FALSTAFF
     My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!
KING HENRY IV
     I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;
     How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
     I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,
     So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;
     But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.
     Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
     Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
     For thee thrice wider than for other men.
     Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:
     Presume not that I am the thing I was;
     For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
     That I have turn'd away my former self;
     So will I those that kept me company.
     When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
     Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
     The tutor and the feeder of my riots:
     Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,
     As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
     Not to come near our person by ten mile.
     For competence of life I will allow you,
     That lack of means enforce you not to evil:
     And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
     We will, according to your strengths and qualities,
     Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,
     To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.
     Exeunt KING HENRY V, & c
FALSTAFF
     Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.
SHALLOW
     Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me
     have home with me.
FALSTAFF
     That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you
     grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to
     him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:
     fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet
     that shall make you great.
SHALLOW
     I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give
     me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I
     beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred
     of my thousand.
FALSTAFF
     Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you
     heard was but a colour.
SHALLOW
     A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
FALSTAFF
     Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,
     Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent
     for soon at night.
     Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; Officers
     with them
     Lord Chief-Justice Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:
     Take all his company along with him.
FALSTAFF
     My lord, my lord,--
     Lord Chief-Justice I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.
     Take them away.
PISTOL
     Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.
     Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice
LANCASTER
     I like this fair proceeding of the king's:
     He hath intent his wonted followers
     Shall all be very well provided for;
     But all are banish'd till their conversations
     Appear more wise and modest to the world.
     Lord Chief-Justice And so they are.
LANCASTER
     The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.
     Lord Chief-Justice He hath.
LANCASTER
     I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
     We bear our civil swords and native fire
     As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,
     Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.
     Come, will you hence?
     Exeunt
     EPILOGUE
     Spoken by a Dancer
     First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.
     My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
     and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
     for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
     to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
     should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
     But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
     known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
     in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
     patience for it and to promise you a better. I
     meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an
     ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
     you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
     I would be and here I commit my body to your
     mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
     as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
     If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
     you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
     light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
     good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
     and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
     forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
     gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which
     was never seen before in such an assembly.
     One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
     much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
     continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make
     you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for
     any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,
     unless already a' be killed with your hard
     opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is
     not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
     too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down
     before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.
