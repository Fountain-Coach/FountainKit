The Life and Death of Richard the Third
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. London. A street. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER, solus
GLOUCESTER
     Now is the winter of our discontent
     Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
     And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
     In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
     Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
     Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
     Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
     Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
     Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
     And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
     To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
     He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
     To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
     But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
     Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
     I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
     To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
     I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
     Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
     Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
     Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
     And that so lamely and unfashionable
     That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
     Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
     Have no delight to pass away the time,
     Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
     And descant on mine own deformity:
     And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
     To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
     I am determined to prove a villain
     And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
     Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
     By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
     To set my brother Clarence and the king
     In deadly hate the one against the other:
     And if King Edward be as true and just
     As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
     This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
     About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
     Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
     Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
     Clarence comes.
     Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY
     Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
     That waits upon your grace?
CLARENCE
     His majesty
     Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
     This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
GLOUCESTER
     Upon what cause?
CLARENCE
     Because my name is George.
GLOUCESTER
     Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
     He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
     O, belike his majesty hath some intent
     That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
     But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?
CLARENCE
     Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
     As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
     He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
     And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
     And says a wizard told him that by G
     His issue disinherited should be;
     And, for my name of George begins with G,
     It follows in his thought that I am he.
     These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
     Have moved his highness to commit me now.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
     'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
     My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
     That tempers him to this extremity.
     Was it not she and that good man of worship,
     Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
     That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
     From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
     We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
CLARENCE
     By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
     But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
     That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
     Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
     Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
GLOUCESTER
     Humbly complaining to her deity
     Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
     I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
     If we will keep in favour with the king,
     To be her men and wear her livery:
     The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
     Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
     Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
BRAKENBURY
     I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
     His majesty hath straitly given in charge
     That no man shall have private conference,
     Of what degree soever, with his brother.
GLOUCESTER
     Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
     You may partake of any thing we say:
     We speak no treason, man: we say the king
     Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
     Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
     We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
     A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
     And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
     How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
BRAKENBURY
     With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
GLOUCESTER
     Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
     He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
     Were best he do it secretly, alone.
BRAKENBURY
     What one, my lord?
GLOUCESTER
     Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
BRAKENBURY
     I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
     Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
CLARENCE
     We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
GLOUCESTER
     We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
     Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
     And whatsoever you will employ me in,
     Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
     I will perform it to enfranchise you.
     Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
     Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
CLARENCE
     I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
GLOUCESTER
     Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
     Meantime, have patience.
CLARENCE
     I must perforce. Farewell.
     Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard
GLOUCESTER
     Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
     Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
     That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
     If heaven will take the present at our hands.
     But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
     Enter HASTINGS
HASTINGS
     Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
GLOUCESTER
     As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
     Well are you welcome to the open air.
     How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
HASTINGS
     With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
     But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
     That were the cause of my imprisonment.
GLOUCESTER
     No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
     For they that were your enemies are his,
     And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
HASTINGS
     More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
     While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
GLOUCESTER
     What news abroad?
HASTINGS
     No news so bad abroad as this at home;
     The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
     And his physicians fear him mightily.
GLOUCESTER
     Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
     O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
     And overmuch consumed his royal person:
     'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
     What, is he in his bed?
HASTINGS
     He is.
GLOUCESTER
     Go you before, and I will follow you.
     Exit HASTINGS
     He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
     Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
     I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
     With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
     And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
     Clarence hath not another day to live:
     Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
     And leave the world for me to bustle in!
     For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
     What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
     The readiest way to make the wench amends
     Is to become her husband and her father:
     The which will I; not all so much for love
     As for another secret close intent,
     By marrying her which I must reach unto.
     But yet I run before my horse to market:
     Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
     When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. The same. Another street. ****
     Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to
     guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner
LADY ANNE
     Set down, set down your honourable load,
     If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
     Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
     The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
     Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
     Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
     Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
     Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
     To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
     Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
     Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
     Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
     I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
     Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
     Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
     Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
     More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
     That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
     Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
     Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
     If ever he have child, abortive be it,
     Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
     Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
     May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
     And that be heir to his unhappiness!
     If ever he have wife, let her he made
     A miserable by the death of him
     As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
     Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
     Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
     And still, as you are weary of the weight,
     Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
     Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
LADY ANNE
     What black magician conjures up this fiend,
     To stop devoted charitable deeds?
GLOUCESTER
     Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
     I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
Gentleman
     My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
GLOUCESTER
     Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
     Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
     Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
     And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
LADY ANNE
     What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
     Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
     And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
     Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
     Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
     His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
GLOUCESTER
     Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
LADY ANNE
     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
     For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
     Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
     If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
     Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
     O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
     Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
     Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
     For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
     From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
     Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
     Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
     O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
     O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
     Either heaven with lightning strike the
     murderer dead,
     Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
     As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
     Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
GLOUCESTER
     Lady, you know no rules of charity,
     Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
LADY ANNE
     Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
     No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
GLOUCESTER
     But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
LADY ANNE
     O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
GLOUCESTER
     More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
     Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
     Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
     By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
LADY ANNE
     Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
     For these known evils, but to give me leave,
     By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
GLOUCESTER
     Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
     Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
LADY ANNE
     Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
     No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
GLOUCESTER
     By such despair, I should accuse myself.
LADY ANNE
     And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
     For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
     Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
GLOUCESTER
     Say that I slew them not?
LADY ANNE
     Why, then they are not dead:
     But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
GLOUCESTER
     I did not kill your husband.
LADY ANNE
     Why, then he is alive.
GLOUCESTER
     Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
LADY ANNE
     In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
     Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
     The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
     But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
GLOUCESTER
     I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
     which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
LADY ANNE
     Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
     Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
     Didst thou not kill this king?
GLOUCESTER
     I grant ye.
LADY ANNE
     Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
     Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
     O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
GLOUCESTER
     The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
LADY ANNE
     He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
GLOUCESTER
     Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
     For he was fitter for that place than earth.
LADY ANNE
     And thou unfit for any place but hell.
GLOUCESTER
     Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
LADY ANNE
     Some dungeon.
GLOUCESTER
     Your bed-chamber.
LADY ANNE
     Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
GLOUCESTER
     So will it, madam till I lie with you.
LADY ANNE
     I hope so.
GLOUCESTER
     I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
     To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
     And fall somewhat into a slower method,
     Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
     Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
     As blameful as the executioner?
LADY ANNE
     Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
GLOUCESTER
     Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
     Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
     To undertake the death of all the world,
     So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
LADY ANNE
     If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
     These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
GLOUCESTER
     These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
     You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
     As all the world is cheered by the sun,
     So I by that; it is my day, my life.
LADY ANNE
     Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
GLOUCESTER
     Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
LADY ANNE
     I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
GLOUCESTER
     It is a quarrel most unnatural,
     To be revenged on him that loveth you.
LADY ANNE
     It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
     To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
GLOUCESTER
     He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
     Did it to help thee to a better husband.
LADY ANNE
     His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
GLOUCESTER
     He lives that loves thee better than he could.
LADY ANNE
     Name him.
GLOUCESTER
     Plantagenet.
LADY ANNE
     Why, that was he.
GLOUCESTER
     The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
LADY ANNE
     Where is he?
GLOUCESTER
     Here.
     She spitteth at him
     Why dost thou spit at me?
LADY ANNE
     Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
GLOUCESTER
     Never came poison from so sweet a place.
LADY ANNE
     Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
     Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
GLOUCESTER
     Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
LADY ANNE
     Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
GLOUCESTER
     I would they were, that I might die at once;
     For now they kill me with a living death.
     Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
     Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
     These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
     No, when my father York and Edward wept,
     To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
     When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
     Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
     Told the sad story of my father's death,
     And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
     That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
     Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
     My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
     And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
     Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
     I never sued to friend nor enemy;
     My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
     But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
     My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
     She looks scornfully at him
     Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
     For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
     If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
     Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
     Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
     And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
     I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
     And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
     He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword
     Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
     But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
     Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
     But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
     Here she lets fall the sword
     Take up the sword again, or take up me.
LADY ANNE
     Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
     I will not be the executioner.
GLOUCESTER
     Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
LADY ANNE
     I have already.
GLOUCESTER
     Tush, that was in thy rage:
     Speak it again, and, even with the word,
     That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
     Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
     To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
LADY ANNE
     I would I knew thy heart.
GLOUCESTER
     'Tis figured in my tongue.
LADY ANNE
     I fear me both are false.
GLOUCESTER
     Then never man was true.
LADY ANNE
     Well, well, put up your sword.
GLOUCESTER
     Say, then, my peace is made.
LADY ANNE
     That shall you know hereafter.
GLOUCESTER
     But shall I live in hope?
LADY ANNE
     All men, I hope, live so.
GLOUCESTER
     Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
LADY ANNE
     To take is not to give.
GLOUCESTER
     Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
     Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
     Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
     And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
     But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
     Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
LADY ANNE
     What is it?
GLOUCESTER
     That it would please thee leave these sad designs
     To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
     And presently repair to Crosby Place;
     Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
     At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
     And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
     I will with all expedient duty see you:
     For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
     Grant me this boon.
LADY ANNE
     With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
     To see you are become so penitent.
     Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
GLOUCESTER
     Bid me farewell.
LADY ANNE
     'Tis more than you deserve;
     But since you teach me how to flatter you,
     Imagine I have said farewell already.
     Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY
GLOUCESTER
     Sirs, take up the corse.
GENTLEMEN
     Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
GLOUCESTER
     No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
     Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
     Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
     Was ever woman in this humour won?
     I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
     What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
     To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
     With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
     The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
     Having God, her conscience, and these bars
     against me,
     And I nothing to back my suit at all,
     But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
     And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
     Ha!
     Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
     Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
     Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
     A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
     Framed in the prodigality of nature,
     Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
     The spacious world cannot again afford
     And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
     That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
     And made her widow to a woful bed?
     On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
     On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
     My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
     I do mistake my person all this while:
     Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
     Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
     I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
     And entertain some score or two of tailors,
     To study fashions to adorn my body:
     Since I am crept in favour with myself,
     Will maintain it with some little cost.
     But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
     And then return lamenting to my love.
     Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
     That I may see my shadow as I pass.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. The palace. ****
     Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY
RIVERS
     Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
     Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
GREY
     In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
     Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
     And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     If he were dead, what would betide of me?
RIVERS
     No other harm but loss of such a lord.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
GREY
     The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
     To be your comforter when he is gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Oh, he is young and his minority
     Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
     A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
RIVERS
     Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     It is determined, not concluded yet:
     But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
     Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
GREY
     Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
BUCKINGHAM
     Good time of day unto your royal grace!
DERBY
     God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
     To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
     Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
     And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
     I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
DERBY
     I do beseech you, either not believe
     The envious slanders of her false accusers;
     Or, if she be accused in true report,
     Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
     From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
RIVERS
     Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
DERBY
     But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
     Are come from visiting his majesty.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
BUCKINGHAM
     Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
BUCKINGHAM
     Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
     Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
     And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
     And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Would all were well! but that will never be
     I fear our happiness is at the highest.
     Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET
GLOUCESTER
     They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
     Who are they that complain unto the king,
     That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
     By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
     That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
     Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
     Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
     Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
     I must be held a rancorous enemy.
     Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
     But thus his simple truth must be abused
     By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
RIVERS
     To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
GLOUCESTER
     To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
     When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
     Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
     A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
     Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
     Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
     But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
     The king, of his own royal disposition,
     And not provoked by any suitor else;
     Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
     Which in your outward actions shows itself
     Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
     Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
     The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
GLOUCESTER
     I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
     That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
     Since every Jack became a gentleman
     There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
     Gloucester;
     You envy my advancement and my friends':
     God grant we never may have need of you!
GLOUCESTER
     Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
     Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
     Myself disgraced, and the nobility
     Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
     Are daily given to ennoble those
     That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     By Him that raised me to this careful height
     From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
     I never did incense his majesty
     Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
     An earnest advocate to plead for him.
     My lord, you do me shameful injury,
     Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
GLOUCESTER
     You may deny that you were not the cause
     Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
RIVERS
     She may, my lord, for--
GLOUCESTER
     She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
     She may do more, sir, than denying that:
     She may help you to many fair preferments,
     And then deny her aiding hand therein,
     And lay those honours on your high deserts.
     What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
RIVERS
     What, marry, may she?
GLOUCESTER
     What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
     A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
     I wis your grandam had a worser match.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
     Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
     By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
     With those gross taunts I often have endured.
     I had rather be a country servant-maid
     Than a great queen, with this condition,
     To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
     Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind
     Small joy have I in being England's queen.
QUEEN MARGARET
     And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
     Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
GLOUCESTER
     What! threat you me with telling of the king?
     Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
     I will avouch in presence of the king:
     I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
     'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Out, devil! I remember them too well:
     Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
     And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
GLOUCESTER
     Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
     I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
     A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
     A liberal rewarder of his friends:
     To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
GLOUCESTER
     In all which time you and your husband Grey
     Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
     And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
     In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
     Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
     What you have been ere now, and what you are;
     Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
QUEEN MARGARET
     A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
GLOUCESTER
     Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
     Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
QUEEN MARGARET
     Which God revenge!
GLOUCESTER
     To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
     And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
     I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
     Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
     I am too childish-foolish for this world.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
     Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
RIVERS
     My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
     Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
     We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
     So should we you, if you should be our king.
GLOUCESTER
     If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
     Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
     You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
     As little joy may you suppose in me.
     That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
QUEEN MARGARET
     A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
     For I am she, and altogether joyless.
     I can no longer hold me patient.
     Advancing
     Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
     In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
     Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
     If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
     Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
     O gentle villain, do not turn away!
GLOUCESTER
     Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
QUEEN MARGARET
     But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
     That will I make before I let thee go.
GLOUCESTER
     Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
QUEEN MARGARET
     I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
     Than death can yield me here by my abode.
     A husband and a son thou owest to me;
     And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
     The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
     And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
GLOUCESTER
     The curse my noble father laid on thee,
     When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
     And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
     And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
     Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
     His curses, then from bitterness of soul
     Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
     And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     So just is God, to right the innocent.
HASTINGS
     O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
     And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
RIVERS
     Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
DORSET
     No man but prophesied revenge for it.
BUCKINGHAM
     Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
QUEEN MARGARET
     What were you snarling all before I came,
     Ready to catch each other by the throat,
     And turn you all your hatred now on me?
     Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
     That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
     Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
     Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
     Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
     Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
     If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
     As ours by murder, to make him a king!
     Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
     For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
     Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
     Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
     Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
     Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
     And see another, as I see thee now,
     Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
     Long die thy happy days before thy death;
     And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
     Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
     Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
     And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
     Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
     That none of you may live your natural age,
     But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
GLOUCESTER
     Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
QUEEN MARGARET
     And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
     If heaven have any grievous plague in store
     Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
     O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
     And then hurl down their indignation
     On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
     The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
     Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
     And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
     No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
     Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
     Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
     Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
     Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
     The slave of nature and the son of hell!
     Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
     Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
     Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
GLOUCESTER
     Margaret.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Richard!
GLOUCESTER
     Ha!
QUEEN MARGARET
     I call thee not.
GLOUCESTER
     I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
     That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
     O, let me make the period to my curse!
GLOUCESTER
     'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
     Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
     Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
     Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
     The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
     To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
HASTINGS
     False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
     Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
RIVERS
     Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
QUEEN MARGARET
     To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
     Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
     O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
DORSET
     Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
     Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
     O, that your young nobility could judge
     What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
     They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
     And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
GLOUCESTER
     Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
DORSET
     It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
GLOUCESTER
     Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
     Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
     And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
QUEEN MARGARET
     And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
     Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
     Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
     Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
     Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
     O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
     As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
BUCKINGHAM
     Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
     Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
     And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
     My charity is outrage, life my shame
     And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
BUCKINGHAM
     Have done, have done.
QUEEN MARGARET
     O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
     In sign of league and amity with thee:
     Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
     Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
     Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
BUCKINGHAM
     Nor no one here; for curses never pass
     The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
QUEEN MARGARET
     I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
     And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
     O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
     Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
     His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
     Have not to do with him, beware of him;
     Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
     And all their ministers attend on him.
GLOUCESTER
     What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM
     Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
QUEEN MARGARET
     What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
     And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
     O, but remember this another day,
     When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
     And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
     Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
     And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
     Exit
HASTINGS
     My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
RIVERS
     And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
GLOUCESTER
     I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
     She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
     My part thereof that I have done to her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     I never did her any, to my knowledge.
GLOUCESTER
     But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
     I was too hot to do somebody good,
     That is too cold in thinking of it now.
     Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
     He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
     God pardon them that are the cause of it!
RIVERS
     A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
     To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
GLOUCESTER
     So do I ever:
     Aside
     being well-advised.
     For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
     Enter CATESBY
CATESBY
     Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
     And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
RIVERS
     Madam, we will attend your grace.
     Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
     The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
     I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
     Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
     I do beweep to many simple gulls
     Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
     And say it is the queen and her allies
     That stir the king against the duke my brother.
     Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
     To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
     But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
     Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
     And thus I clothe my naked villany
     With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
     And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
     Enter two Murderers
     But, soft! here come my executioners.
     How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
     Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
First Murderer
     We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
     That we may be admitted where he is.
GLOUCESTER
     Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
     Gives the warrant
     When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
     But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
     Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
     For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
     May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
First Murderer
     Tush!
     Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
     Talkers are no good doers: be assured
     We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
GLOUCESTER
     Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
     I like you, lads; about your business straight;
     Go, go, dispatch.
First Murderer
     We will, my noble lord.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. The Tower. ****
     Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
BRAKENBURY
     Why looks your grace so heavily today?
CLARENCE
     O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
     So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
     That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
     I would not spend another such a night,
     Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
     So full of dismal terror was the time!
BRAKENBURY
     What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
CLARENCE
     Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
     And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
     And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
     Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
     Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
     And cited up a thousand fearful times,
     During the wars of York and Lancaster
     That had befall'n us. As we paced along
     Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
     Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
     Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
     Into the tumbling billows of the main.
     Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
     What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
     What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
     Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
     Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
     Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
     Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
     All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
     Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
     Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
     As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
     Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
     And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
BRAKENBURY
     Had you such leisure in the time of death
     To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
CLARENCE
     Methought I had; and often did I strive
     To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
     Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
     To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
     But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
     Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
BRAKENBURY
     Awaked you not with this sore agony?
CLARENCE
     O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
     O, then began the tempest to my soul,
     Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
     With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
     Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
     The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
     Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
     Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
     Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
     And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
     A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
     Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
     'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
     That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
     Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
     With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
     Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
     Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
     I trembling waked, and for a season after
     Could not believe but that I was in hell,
     Such terrible impression made the dream.
BRAKENBURY
     No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
     I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
CLARENCE
     O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
     Which now bear evidence against my soul,
     For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
     O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
     But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
     Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
     O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
     I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
     My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
BRAKENBURY
     I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
     CLARENCE sleeps
     Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
     Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
     Princes have but their tides for their glories,
     An outward honour for an inward toil;
     And, for unfelt imagination,
     They often feel a world of restless cares:
     So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
     There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
     Enter the two Murderers
First Murderer
     Ho! who's here?
BRAKENBURY
     In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
First Murderer
     I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
BRAKENBURY
     Yea, are you so brief?
Second Murderer
     O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
     him our commission; talk no more.
     BRAKENBURY reads it
BRAKENBURY
     I am, in this, commanded to deliver
     The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
     I will not reason what is meant hereby,
     Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
     Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
     I'll to the king; and signify to him
     That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
First Murderer
     Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
     Exit BRAKENBURY
Second Murderer
     What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
First Murderer
     No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
Second Murderer
     When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
     the judgment-day.
First Murderer
     Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
Second Murderer
     The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
     of remorse in me.
First Murderer
     What, art thou afraid?
Second Murderer
     Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
     damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
First Murderer
     I thought thou hadst been resolute.
Second Murderer
     So I am, to let him live.
First Murderer
     Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
Second Murderer
     I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
     will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
     would tell twenty.
First Murderer
     How dost thou feel thyself now?
Second Murderer
     'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
     within me.
First Murderer
     Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
Second Murderer
     'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
First Murderer
     Where is thy conscience now?
Second Murderer
     In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
First Murderer
     So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
     thy conscience flies out.
Second Murderer
     Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
First Murderer
     How if it come to thee again?
Second Murderer
     I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
     makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
     accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
     he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
     detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
     mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
     obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
     that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
     is turned out of all towns and cities for a
     dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
     well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
     without it.
First Murderer
     'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
     not to kill the duke.
Second Murderer
     Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
     would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
First Murderer
     Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
     I warrant thee.
Second Murderer
     Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
     reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
First Murderer
     Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
     sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
     in the next room.
Second Murderer
     O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
First Murderer
     Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
Second Murderer
     No, first let's reason with him.
CLARENCE
     Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
Second murderer
     You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
CLARENCE
     In God's name, what art thou?
Second Murderer
     A man, as you are.
CLARENCE
     But not, as I am, royal.
Second Murderer
     Nor you, as we are, loyal.
CLARENCE
     Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
Second Murderer
     My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
CLARENCE
     How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
     Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
     Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
Both
     To, to, to--
CLARENCE
     To murder me?
Both
     Ay, ay.
CLARENCE
     You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
     And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
     Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
First Murderer
     Offended us you have not, but the king.
CLARENCE
     I shall be reconciled to him again.
Second Murderer
     Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
CLARENCE
     Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
     To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
     Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
     What lawful quest have given their verdict up
     Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
     The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
     Before I be convict by course of law,
     To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
     I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
     By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
     That you depart and lay no hands on me
     The deed you undertake is damnable.
First Murderer
     What we will do, we do upon command.
Second Murderer
     And he that hath commanded is the king.
CLARENCE
     Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
     Hath in the tables of his law commanded
     That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
     Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
     Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
     To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
Second Murderer
     And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
     For false forswearing and for murder too:
     Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
     To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
First Murderer
     And, like a traitor to the name of God,
     Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
     Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
Second Murderer
     Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
First Murderer
     How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
     When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
CLARENCE
     Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
     For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
     He sends ye not to murder me for this
     For in this sin he is as deep as I.
     If God will be revenged for this deed.
     O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
     Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
     He needs no indirect nor lawless course
     To cut off those that have offended him.
First Murderer
     Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
     When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
     That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
CLARENCE
     My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
First Murderer
     Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
     Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
CLARENCE
     Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
     I am his brother, and I love him well.
     If you be hired for meed, go back again,
     And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
     Who shall reward you better for my life
     Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
Second Murderer
     You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
CLARENCE
     O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
     Go you to him from me.
Both
     Ay, so we will.
CLARENCE
     Tell him, when that our princely father York
     Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
     And charged us from his soul to love each other,
     He little thought of this divided friendship:
     Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
First Murderer
     Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
CLARENCE
     O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
First Murderer
     Right,
     As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
     'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
CLARENCE
     It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
     He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
     That he would labour my delivery.
Second Murderer
     Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
     From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
First Murderer
     Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
CLARENCE
     Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
     To counsel me to make my peace with God,
     And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
     That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
     Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
     To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
Second Murderer
     What shall we do?
CLARENCE
     Relent, and save your souls.
First Murderer
     Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
CLARENCE
     Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
     Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
     Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
     if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
     Would not entreat for life?
     My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
     O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
     Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
     As you would beg, were you in my distress
     A begging prince what beggar pities not?
Second Murderer
     Look behind you, my lord.
First Murderer
     Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
     Stabs him
     I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
     Exit, with the body
Second Murderer
     A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
     How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
     Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
     Re-enter First Murderer
First Murderer
     How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
     By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
Second Murderer
     I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
     Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
     For I repent me that the duke is slain.
     Exit
First Murderer
     So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
     Now must I hide his body in some hole,
     Until the duke take order for his burial:
     And when I have my meed, I must away;
     For this will out, and here I must not stay.
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. London. The palace. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS,
     HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others
KING EDWARD IV
     Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
     You peers, continue this united league:
     I every day expect an embassage
     From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
     And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
     Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
     Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
     Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
RIVERS
     By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
     And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
HASTINGS
     So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
KING EDWARD IV
     Take heed you dally not before your king;
     Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
     Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
     Either of you to be the other's end.
HASTINGS
     So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
RIVERS
     And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
KING EDWARD IV
     Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
     Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
     You have been factious one against the other,
     Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
     And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
     Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
KING EDWARD IV
     Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
DORSET
     This interchange of love, I here protest,
     Upon my part shall be unviolable.
HASTINGS
     And so swear I, my lord
     They embrace
KING EDWARD IV
     Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
     With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
     And make me happy in your unity.
BUCKINGHAM
     Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
     On you or yours,
     To the Queen
     but with all duteous love
     Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
     With hate in those where I expect most love!
     When I have most need to employ a friend,
     And most assured that he is a friend
     Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
     Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
     When I am cold in zeal to yours.
KING EDWARD IV
     A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
     is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
     There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
     To make the perfect period of this peace.
BUCKINGHAM
     And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
     Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
     And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
KING EDWARD IV
     Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
     Brother, we done deeds of charity;
     Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
     Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
GLOUCESTER
     A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
     Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
     By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
     Hold me a foe;
     If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
     Have aught committed that is hardly borne
     By any in this presence, I desire
     To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
     'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
     I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
     First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
     Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
     Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
     If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
     Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
     That without desert have frown'd on me;
     Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
     I do not know that Englishman alive
     With whom my soul is any jot at odds
     More than the infant that is born to-night
     I thank my God for my humility.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
     I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
     My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
     To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
     To be so bouted in this royal presence?
     Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
     They all start
     You do him injury to scorn his corse.
RIVERS
     Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
BUCKINGHAM
     Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
DORSET
     Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
     But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
KING EDWARD IV
     Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
GLOUCESTER
     But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
     And that a winged Mercury did bear:
     Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
     That came too lag to see him buried.
     God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
     Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
     Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
     And yet go current from suspicion!
     Enter DERBY
DERBY
     A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
KING EDWARD IV
     I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
DERBY
     I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
KING EDWARD IV
     Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
DERBY
     The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
     Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
     Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
KING EDWARD IV
     Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
     And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
     My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
     And yet his punishment was cruel death.
     Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
     Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
     Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
     Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
     The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
     Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
     When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
     And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
     Who told me, when we both lay in the field
     Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
     Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
     All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
     All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
     Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
     Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
     But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
     Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
     The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
     You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
     And I unjustly too, must grant it you
     But for my brother not a man would speak,
     Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
     For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
     Have been beholding to him in his life;
     Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
     O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
     On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
     Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
     Oh, poor Clarence!
     Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET
GLOUCESTER
     This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
     How that the guilty kindred of the queen
     Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
     O, they did urge it still unto the king!
     God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
     To comfort Edward with our company.
BUCKINGHAM
     We wait upon your grace.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The palace. ****
     Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE
Boy
     Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     No, boy.
Boy
     Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
     And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
Girl
     Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
     And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
     If that our noble father be alive?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
     I do lament the sickness of the king.
     As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
     It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
Boy
     Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
     The king my uncle is to blame for this:
     God will revenge it; whom I will importune
     With daily prayers all to that effect.
Girl
     And so will I.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
     Incapable and shallow innocents,
     You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
Boy
     Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
     Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
     Devised impeachments to imprison him :
     And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
     And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
     Bade me rely on him as on my father,
     And he would love me dearly as his child.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
     And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
     He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
     Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
Boy
     Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Ay, boy.
Boy
     I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
     Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears; RIVERS, and
     DORSET after her
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
     To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
     I'll join with black despair against my soul,
     And to myself become an enemy.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     What means this scene of rude impatience?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     To make an act of tragic violence:
     Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
     Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
     Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
     If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
     That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
     Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
     To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
     As I had title in thy noble husband!
     I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
     And lived by looking on his images:
     But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
     Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
     And I for comfort have but one false glass,
     Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
     Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
     And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
     But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
     And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
     Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
     Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
     To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
Boy
     Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
     How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
Girl
     Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
     Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Give me no help in lamentation;
     I am not barren to bring forth complaints
     All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
     That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
     May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
     Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
Children
     Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
Children
     What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Was never widow had so dear a loss!
Children
     Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Was never mother had so dear a loss!
     Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
     Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
     She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
     I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
     These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
     I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
     Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
     Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
     And I will pamper it with lamentations.
DORSET
     Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
     That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
     In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
     With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
     Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
     Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
     For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
RIVERS
     Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
     Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
     Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
     Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
     And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
     Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF
GLOUCESTER
     Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
     To wail the dimming of our shining star;
     But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
     Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
     I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
     I crave your blessing.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
     Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] Amen; and make me die a good old man!
     That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
     I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
BUCKINGHAM
     You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
     That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
     Now cheer each other in each other's love
     Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
     We are to reap the harvest of his son.
     The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
     But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
     Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
     Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
     Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
     Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
RIVERS
     Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM
     Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
     The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
     Which would be so much the more dangerous
     By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
     Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
     And may direct his course as please himself,
     As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
     In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
GLOUCESTER
     I hope the king made peace with all of us
     And the compact is firm and true in me.
RIVERS
     And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
     Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
     To no apparent likelihood of breach,
     Which haply by much company might be urged:
     Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
     That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
HASTINGS
     And so say I.
GLOUCESTER
     Then be it so; and go we to determine
     Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
     Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
     To give your censures in this weighty business?
QUEEN ELIZABETH DUCHESS OF YORK
     With all our harts.
     Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
BUCKINGHAM
     My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
     For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
     For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
     As index to the story we late talk'd of,
     To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
GLOUCESTER
     My other self, my counsel's consistory,
     My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
     I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
     Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. London. A street. ****
     Enter two Citizens meeting
First Citizen
     Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
Second Citizen
     I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
     Hear you the news abroad?
First Citizen
     Ay, that the king is dead.
Second Citizen
     Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
     I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
     Enter another Citizen
Third Citizen
     Neighbours, God speed!
First Citizen
     Give you good morrow, sir.
Third Citizen
     Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
Second Citizen
     Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
Third Citizen
     Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
First Citizen
     No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
Third Citizen
     Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
Second Citizen
     In him there is a hope of government,
     That in his nonage council under him,
     And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
     No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
First Citizen
     So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
     Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Third Citizen
     Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
     For then this land was famously enrich'd
     With politic grave counsel; then the king
     Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
First Citizen
     Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
Third Citizen
     Better it were they all came by the father,
     Or by the father there were none at all;
     For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
     Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
     O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
     And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
     And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
     This sickly land might solace as before.
First Citizen
     Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
Third Citizen
     When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
     When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
     When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
     Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
     All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
     'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
Second Citizen
     Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
     Ye cannot reason almost with a man
     That looks not heavily and full of fear.
Third Citizen
     Before the times of change, still is it so:
     By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
     Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
     The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
     But leave it all to God. whither away?
Second Citizen
     Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
Third Citizen
     And so was I: I'll bear you company.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. The palace. ****
     Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and the
     DUCHESS OF YORK
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
     At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
     To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I long with all my heart to see the prince:
     I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     But I hear, no; they say my son of York
     Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
YORK
     Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
YORK
     Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
     My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
     More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
     Gloucester,
     'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
     And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
     Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
     In him that did object the same to thee;
     He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
     So long a-growing and so leisurely,
     That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
YORK
     Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
     I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
     To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
YORK
     Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
     That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
     'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
     Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
YORK
     Grandam, his nurse.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
YORK
     If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Good madam, be not angry with the child.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Pitchers have ears.
     Enter a Messenger
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Here comes a messenger. What news?
Messenger
     Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     How fares the prince?
Messenger
     Well, madam, and in health.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     What is thy news then?
Messenger
     Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
     With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Who hath committed them?
Messenger
     The mighty dukes
     Gloucester and Buckingham.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     For what offence?
Messenger
     The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
     Why or for what these nobles were committed
     Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
     The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
     Insulting tyranny begins to jet
     Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
     Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
     I see, as in a map, the end of all.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
     How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
     My husband lost his life to get the crown;
     And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
     For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
     And being seated, and domestic broils
     Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
     Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
     Self against self: O, preposterous
     And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
     Or let me die, to look on death no more!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
     Madam, farewell.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I'll go along with you.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     You have no cause.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     My gracious lady, go;
     And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
     For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
     The seal I keep: and so betide to me
     As well I tender you and all of yours!
     Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. London. A street. ****
     The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD, GLOUCESTER,
     BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others
BUCKINGHAM
     Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
GLOUCESTER
     Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
     The weary way hath made you melancholy.
PRINCE EDWARD
     No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
     Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
     I want more uncles here to welcome me.
GLOUCESTER
     Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
     Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
     Nor more can you distinguish of a man
     Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
     Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
     Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
     Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
     But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
     God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
PRINCE EDWARD
     God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
GLOUCESTER
     My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
     Enter the Lord Mayor and his train
Lord Mayor
     God bless your grace with health and happy days!
PRINCE EDWARD
     I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
     I thought my mother, and my brother York,
     Would long ere this have met us on the way
     Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
     To tell us whether they will come or no!
     Enter HASTINGS
BUCKINGHAM
     And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
HASTINGS
     On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
     The queen your mother, and your brother York,
     Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
     Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
     But by his mother was perforce withheld.
BUCKINGHAM
     Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
     Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
     Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
     Unto his princely brother presently?
     If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
     And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
CARDINAL
     My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
     Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
     Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
     To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
     We should infringe the holy privilege
     Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
     Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
BUCKINGHAM
     You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
     Too ceremonious and traditional
     Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
     You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
     The benefit thereof is always granted
     To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
     And those who have the wit to claim the place:
     This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
     And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
     Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
     You break no privilege nor charter there.
     Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
     But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
CARDINAL
     My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
     Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
HASTINGS
     I go, my lord.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
     Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
     Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
     Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
GLOUCESTER
     Where it seems best unto your royal self.
     If I may counsel you, some day or two
     Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
     Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
     For your best health and recreation.
PRINCE EDWARD
     I do not like the Tower, of any place.
     Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
BUCKINGHAM
     He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
     Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Is it upon record, or else reported
     Successively from age to age, he built it?
BUCKINGHAM
     Upon record, my gracious lord.
PRINCE EDWARD
     But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
     Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
     As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
     Even to the general all-ending day.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] So wise so young, they say, do never
     live long.
PRINCE EDWARD
     What say you, uncle?
GLOUCESTER
     I say, without characters, fame lives long.
     Aside
     Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
     I moralize two meanings in one word.
PRINCE EDWARD
     That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
     With what his valour did enrich his wit,
     His wit set down to make his valour live
     Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
     For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
     I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
BUCKINGHAM
     What, my gracious lord?
PRINCE EDWARD
     An if I live until I be a man,
     I'll win our ancient right in France again,
     Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
     Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL
BUCKINGHAM
     Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
YORK
     Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
     Too late he died that might have kept that title,
     Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
GLOUCESTER
     How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
YORK
     I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
     You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
     The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
GLOUCESTER
     He hath, my lord.
YORK
     And therefore is he idle?
GLOUCESTER
     O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
YORK
     Then is he more beholding to you than I.
GLOUCESTER
     He may command me as my sovereign;
     But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
YORK
     I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
GLOUCESTER
     My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
PRINCE EDWARD
     A beggar, brother?
YORK
     Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
     And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
GLOUCESTER
     A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
YORK
     A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
GLOUCESTER
     A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
YORK
     O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
     In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
GLOUCESTER
     It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
YORK
     I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
GLOUCESTER
     What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
YORK
     I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
GLOUCESTER
     How?
YORK
     Little.
PRINCE EDWARD
     My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
     Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
YORK
     You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
     Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
     Because that I am little, like an ape,
     He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
BUCKINGHAM
     With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
     To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
     He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
     So cunning and so young is wonderful.
GLOUCESTER
     My lord, will't please you pass along?
     Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
     Will to your mother, to entreat of her
     To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
YORK
     What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
PRINCE EDWARD
     My lord protector needs will have it so.
YORK
     I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, what should you fear?
YORK
     Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
     My grandam told me he was murdered there.
PRINCE EDWARD
     I fear no uncles dead.
GLOUCESTER
     Nor none that live, I hope.
PRINCE EDWARD
     An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
     But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
     Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
     A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM
     Think you, my lord, this little prating York
     Was not incensed by his subtle mother
     To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
GLOUCESTER
     No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
     Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
     He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
BUCKINGHAM
     Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
     Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
     As closely to conceal what we impart:
     Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
     What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
     To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
     For the instalment of this noble duke
     In the seat royal of this famous isle?
CATESBY
     He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
     That he will not be won to aught against him.
BUCKINGHAM
     What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
CATESBY
     He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
BUCKINGHAM
     Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
     And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
     How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
     And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
     To sit about the coronation.
     If thou dost find him tractable to us,
     Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
     If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
     Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
     And give us notice of his inclination:
     For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
     Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
GLOUCESTER
     Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
     His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
     To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
     And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
     Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
BUCKINGHAM
     Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
CATESBY
     My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
GLOUCESTER
     Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
CATESBY
     You shall, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
     Exit CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM
     Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
     Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
GLOUCESTER
     Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
     And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
     The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
     Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
BUCKINGHAM
     I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
GLOUCESTER
     And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
     Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
     We may digest our complots in some form.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house. ****
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     What, ho! my lord!
HASTINGS
     [Within] Who knocks at the door?
Messenger
     A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
     Enter HASTINGS
HASTINGS
     What is't o'clock?
Messenger
     Upon the stroke of four.
HASTINGS
     Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
Messenger
     So it should seem by that I have to say.
     First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
HASTINGS
     And then?
Messenger
     And then he sends you word
     He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
     Besides, he says there are two councils held;
     And that may be determined at the one
     which may make you and him to rue at the other.
     Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
     If presently you will take horse with him,
     And with all speed post with him toward the north,
     To shun the danger that his soul divines.
HASTINGS
     Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
     Bid him not fear the separated councils
     His honour and myself are at the one,
     And at the other is my servant Catesby
     Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
     Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
     Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
     And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
     To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
     To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
     Were to incense the boar to follow us
     And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
     Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
     And we will both together to the Tower,
     Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
Messenger
     My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
     Exit
     Enter CATESBY
CATESBY
     Many good morrows to my noble lord!
HASTINGS
     Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
     What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
CATESBY
     It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
     And I believe twill never stand upright
     Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
HASTINGS
     How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
CATESBY
     Ay, my good lord.
HASTINGS
     I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
     Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
     But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
CATESBY
     Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
     Upon his party for the gain thereof:
     And thereupon he sends you this good news,
     That this same very day your enemies,
     The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
HASTINGS
     Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
     Because they have been still mine enemies:
     But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
     To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
     God knows I will not do it, to the death.
CATESBY
     God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
HASTINGS
     But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
     That they who brought me in my master's hate
     I live to look upon their tragedy.
     I tell thee, Catesby--
CATESBY
     What, my lord?
HASTINGS
     Ere a fortnight make me elder,
     I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
CATESBY
     'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
     When men are unprepared and look not for it.
HASTINGS
     O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
     With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
     With some men else, who think themselves as safe
     As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
     To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
CATESBY
     The princes both make high account of you;
     Aside
     For they account his head upon the bridge.
HASTINGS
     I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
     Enter STANLEY
     Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
     Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
STANLEY
     My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
     You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
     I do not like these several councils, I.
HASTINGS
     My lord,
     I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
     And never in my life, I do protest,
     Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
     Think you, but that I know our state secure,
     I would be so triumphant as I am?
STANLEY
     The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
     Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
     And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
     But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
     This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
     Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
     What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
HASTINGS
     Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
     To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
LORD STANLEY
     They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
     Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
     But come, my lord, let us away.
     Enter a Pursuivant
HASTINGS
     Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
     Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
     How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
Pursuivant
     The better that your lordship please to ask.
HASTINGS
     I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
     Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
     Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
     By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
     But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
     This day those enemies are put to death,
     And I in better state than e'er I was.
Pursuivant
     God hold it, to your honour's good content!
HASTINGS
     Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
     Throws him his purse
Pursuivant
     God save your lordship!
     Exit
     Enter a Priest
Priest
     Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
HASTINGS
     I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
     I am in your debt for your last exercise;
     Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
     He whispers in his ear
     Enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM
     What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
     Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
     Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
HASTINGS
     Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
     Those men you talk of came into my mind.
     What, go you toward the Tower?
BUCKINGHAM
     I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
     I shall return before your lordship thence.
HASTINGS
     'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
BUCKINGHAM
     [Aside] And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
     Come, will you go?
HASTINGS
     I'll wait upon your lordship.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Pomfret Castle. ****
     Enter RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN to
     death
RATCLIFF
     Come, bring forth the prisoners.
RIVERS
     Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
     To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
     For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
GREY
     God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
     A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
VAUGHAN
     You live that shall cry woe for this after.
RATCLIFF
     Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
RIVERS
     O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
     Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
     Within the guilty closure of thy walls
     Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
     And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
     We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
GREY
     Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
     For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
RIVERS
     Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
     Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
     To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
     And for my sister and her princely sons,
     Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
     Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
RATCLIFF
     Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
RIVERS
     Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
     And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. The Tower of London. ****
     Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF ELY, RATCLIFF,
     LOVEL, with others, and take their seats at a table
HASTINGS
     My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
     Is, to determine of the coronation.
     In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
BUCKINGHAM
     Are all things fitting for that royal time?
DERBY
     It is, and wants but nomination.
BISHOP OF ELY
     To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
BUCKINGHAM
     Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
     Who is most inward with the royal duke?
BISHOP OF ELY
     Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
BUCKINGHAM
     Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
     But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
     Than I of yours;
     Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
     Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
HASTINGS
     I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
     But, for his purpose in the coronation.
     I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
     His gracious pleasure any way therein:
     But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
     And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
     Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
     Enter GLOUCESTER
BISHOP OF ELY
     Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
GLOUCESTER
     My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
     I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
     My absence doth neglect no great designs,
     Which by my presence might have been concluded.
BUCKINGHAM
     Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
     William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
     I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
GLOUCESTER
     Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
     His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
HASTINGS
     I thank your grace.
GLOUCESTER
     My lord of Ely!
BISHOP OF ELY
     My lord?
GLOUCESTER
     When I was last in Holborn,
     I saw good strawberries in your garden there
     I do beseech you send for some of them.
BISHOP OF ELY
     Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
     Exit
GLOUCESTER
     Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
     Drawing him aside
     Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
     And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
     As he will lose his head ere give consent
     His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
     Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
BUCKINGHAM
     Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
     Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following
DERBY
     We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
     To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
     For I myself am not so well provided
     As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
     Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY
BISHOP OF ELY
     Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
     strawberries.
HASTINGS
     His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
     There's some conceit or other likes him well,
     When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
     I think there's never a man in Christendom
     That can less hide his love or hate than he;
     For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
DERBY
     What of his heart perceive you in his face
     By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
HASTINGS
     Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
     For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
DERBY
     I pray God he be not, I say.
     Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
GLOUCESTER
     I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
     That do conspire my death with devilish plots
     Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
     Upon my body with their hellish charms?
HASTINGS
     The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
     Makes me most forward in this noble presence
     To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
     I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
GLOUCESTER
     Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
     See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
     Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
     And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
     Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
     That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
HASTINGS
     If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
GLOUCESTER
     If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
     Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:
     Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
     I will not dine until I see the same.
     Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
     The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
     Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL
HASTINGS
     Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
     For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
     Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
     But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
     Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
     And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
     As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
     O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
     I now repent I told the pursuivant
     As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
     How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
     And I myself secure in grace and favour.
     O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
     Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
RATCLIFF
     Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
     Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
HASTINGS
     O momentary grace of mortal men,
     Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
     Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
     Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
     Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
     Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
LOVEL
     Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
HASTINGS
     O bloody Richard! miserable England!
     I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
     That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
     Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
     They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. The Tower-walls. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-
     favoured
GLOUCESTER
     Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
     Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
     And then begin again, and stop again,
     As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
BUCKINGHAM
     Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
     Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
     Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
     Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
     Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
     And both are ready in their offices,
     At any time, to grace my stratagems.
     But what, is Catesby gone?
GLOUCESTER
     He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
     Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM
     Lord mayor,--
GLOUCESTER
     Look to the drawbridge there!
BUCKINGHAM
     Hark! a drum.
GLOUCESTER
     Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
BUCKINGHAM
     Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
GLOUCESTER
     Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
BUCKINGHAM
     God and our innocency defend and guard us!
GLOUCESTER
     Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
     Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head
LOVEL
     Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
     The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
GLOUCESTER
     So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
     I took him for the plainest harmless creature
     That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
     Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
     The history of all her secret thoughts:
     So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
     That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
     I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
     He lived from all attainder of suspect.
BUCKINGHAM
     Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
     That ever lived.
     Would you imagine, or almost believe,
     Were't not that, by great preservation,
     We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
     This day had plotted, in the council-house
     To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
Lord Mayor
     What, had he so?
GLOUCESTER
     What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
     Or that we would, against the form of law,
     Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
     But that the extreme peril of the case,
     The peace of England and our persons' safety,
     Enforced us to this execution?
Lord Mayor
     Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
     And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
     To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
     I never look'd for better at his hands,
     After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
GLOUCESTER
     Yet had not we determined he should die,
     Until your lordship came to see his death;
     Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
     Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
     Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
     The traitor speak, and timorously confess
     The manner and the purpose of his treason;
     That you might well have signified the same
     Unto the citizens, who haply may
     Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
Lord Mayor
     But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
     As well as I had seen and heard him speak
     And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
     But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
     With all your just proceedings in this cause.
GLOUCESTER
     And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
     To avoid the carping censures of the world.
BUCKINGHAM
     But since you come too late of our intents,
     Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
     And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
     Exit Lord Mayor
GLOUCESTER
     Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
     The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
     There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
     Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
     Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
     Only for saying he would make his son
     Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
     Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
     Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
     And bestial appetite in change of lust;
     Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
     Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
     Without control, listed to make his prey.
     Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
     Tell them, when that my mother went with child
     Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
     My princely father then had wars in France
     And, by just computation of the time,
     Found that the issue was not his begot;
     Which well appeared in his lineaments,
     Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
     But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
     Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
BUCKINGHAM
     Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
     As if the golden fee for which I plead
     Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
GLOUCESTER
     If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
     Where you shall find me well accompanied
     With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
BUCKINGHAM
     I go: and towards three or four o'clock
     Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
     Exit BUCKINGHAM
GLOUCESTER
     Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
     To CATESBY
     Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
     Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
     Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
     Now will I in, to take some privy order,
     To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
     And to give notice, that no manner of person
     At any time have recourse unto the princes.
     Exit
**** SCENE VI. The same. ****
     Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand
Scrivener
     This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
     Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
     That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
     And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
     Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
     For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
     The precedent was full as long a-doing:
     And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
     Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
     Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
     That seeth not this palpable device?
     Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
     Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
     When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
     Exit
**** SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors
GLOUCESTER
     How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
BUCKINGHAM
     Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
     The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
GLOUCESTER
     Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
BUCKINGHAM
     I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
     And his contract by deputy in France;
     The insatiate greediness of his desires,
     And his enforcement of the city wives;
     His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
     As being got, your father then in France,
     His resemblance, being not like the duke;
     Withal I did infer your lineaments,
     Being the right idea of your father,
     Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
     Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
     Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
     Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
     Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
     Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
     And when mine oratory grew to an end
     I bid them that did love their country's good
     Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
GLOUCESTER
     Ah! and did they so?
BUCKINGHAM
     No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
     But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
     Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
     Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
     And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
     His answer was, the people were not wont
     To be spoke to but by the recorder.
     Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
     'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
     But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
     When he had done, some followers of mine own,
     At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
     And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
     And thus I took the vantage of those few,
     'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
     'This general applause and loving shout
     Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
     And even here brake off, and came away.
GLOUCESTER
     What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
BUCKINGHAM
     No, by my troth, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
BUCKINGHAM
     The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
     Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
     And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
     And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
     For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
     And be not easily won to our request:
     Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
GLOUCESTER
     I go; and if you plead as well for them
     As I can say nay to thee for myself,
     No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
BUCKINGHAM
     Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
     Exit GLOUCESTER
     Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens
     Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
     I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
     Enter CATESBY
     Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
     What says he?
CATESBY
     My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
     To visit him to-morrow or next day:
     He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
     Divinely bent to meditation;
     And no worldly suit would he be moved,
     To draw him from his holy exercise.
BUCKINGHAM
     Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
     Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
     In deep designs and matters of great moment,
     No less importing than our general good,
     Are come to have some conference with his grace.
CATESBY
     I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
     Exit
BUCKINGHAM
     Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
     He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
     But on his knees at meditation;
     Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
     But meditating with two deep divines;
     Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
     But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
     Happy were England, would this gracious prince
     Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
     But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
Lord Mayor
     Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
BUCKINGHAM
     I fear he will.
     Re-enter CATESBY
     How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
CATESBY
     My lord,
     He wonders to what end you have assembled
     Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
     His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
     My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
BUCKINGHAM
     Sorry I am my noble cousin should
     Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
     By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
     And so once more return and tell his grace.
     Exit CATESBY
     When holy and devout religious men
     Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
     So sweet is zealous contemplation.
     Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns
Lord Mayor
     See, where he stands between two clergymen!
BUCKINGHAM
     Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
     To stay him from the fall of vanity:
     And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
     True ornaments to know a holy man.
     Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
     Lend favourable ears to our request;
     And pardon us the interruption
     Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
GLOUCESTER
     My lord, there needs no such apology:
     I rather do beseech you pardon me,
     Who, earnest in the service of my God,
     Neglect the visitation of my friends.
     But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
BUCKINGHAM
     Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
     And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
GLOUCESTER
     I do suspect I have done some offence
     That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
     And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
BUCKINGHAM
     You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
     At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
GLOUCESTER
     Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
BUCKINGHAM
     Then know, it is your fault that you resign
     The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
     The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
     Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
     The lineal glory of your royal house,
     To the corruption of a blemished stock:
     Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
     Which here we waken to our country's good,
     This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
     Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
     Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
     And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
     Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
     Which to recure, we heartily solicit
     Your gracious self to take on you the charge
     And kingly government of this your land,
     Not as protector, steward, substitute,
     Or lowly factor for another's gain;
     But as successively from blood to blood,
     Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
     For this, consorted with the citizens,
     Your very worshipful and loving friends,
     And by their vehement instigation,
     In this just suit come I to move your grace.
GLOUCESTER
     I know not whether to depart in silence,
     Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
     Best fitteth my degree or your condition
     If not to answer, you might haply think
     Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
     To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
     Which fondly you would here impose on me;
     If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
     So season'd with your faithful love to me.
     Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
     Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
     And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
     Definitively thus I answer you.
     Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
     Unmeritable shuns your high request.
     First if all obstacles were cut away,
     And that my path were even to the crown,
     As my ripe revenue and due by birth
     Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
     So mighty and so many my defects,
     As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
     Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
     Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
     And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
     But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
     And much I need to help you, if need were;
     The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
     Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
     Will well become the seat of majesty,
     And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
     On him I lay what you would lay on me,
     The right and fortune of his happy stars;
     Which God defend that I should wring from him!
BUCKINGHAM
     My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
     But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
     All circumstances well considered.
     You say that Edward is your brother's son:
     So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
     For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
     Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
     And afterward by substitute betroth'd
     To Bona, sister to the King of France.
     These both put by a poor petitioner,
     A care-crazed mother of a many children,
     A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
     Even in the afternoon of her best days,
     Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
     Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
     To base declension and loathed bigamy
     By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
     This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
     More bitterly could I expostulate,
     Save that, for reverence to some alive,
     I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
     Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
     This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
     If non to bless us and the land withal,
     Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
     From the corruption of abusing times,
     Unto a lineal true-derived course.
Lord Mayor
     Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
BUCKINGHAM
     Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
CATESBY
     O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
GLOUCESTER
     Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
     I am unfit for state and majesty;
     I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
     I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
BUCKINGHAM
     If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
     Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
     As well we know your tenderness of heart
     And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
     Which we have noted in you to your kin,
     And egally indeed to all estates,--
     Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
     Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
     But we will plant some other in the throne,
     To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
     And in this resolution here we leave you.--
     Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
GLOUCESTER
     O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
     Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens
CATESBY
     Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
ANOTHER
     Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
GLOUCESTER
     Would you enforce me to a world of care?
     Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
     But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
     Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
     Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest
     Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
     Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
     To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
     I must have patience to endure the load:
     But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
     Attend the sequel of your imposition,
     Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
     From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
     For God he knows, and you may partly see,
     How far I am from the desire thereof.
Lord Mayor
     God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
GLOUCESTER
     In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
BUCKINGHAM
     Then I salute you with this kingly title:
     Long live Richard, England's royal king!
Lord Mayor Citizens
     Amen.
BUCKINGHAM
     To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
GLOUCESTER
     Even when you please, since you will have it so.
BUCKINGHAM
     To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
     And so most joyfully we take our leave.
GLOUCESTER
     Come, let us to our holy task again.
     Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
     Exeunt
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. Before the Tower. ****
     Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF YORK, and DORSET; on
     the other, ANNE, Duchess of Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret
     Plantagenet, CLARENCE's young Daughter
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Who m eets us here? my niece Plantagenet
     Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
     Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
     On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
     Daughter, well met.
LADY ANNE
     God give your graces both
     A happy and a joyful time of day!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
LADY ANNE
     No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
     Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
     To gratulate the gentle princes there.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
     Enter BRAKENBURY
     And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
     Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
     How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
BRAKENBURY
     Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
     I may not suffer you to visit them;
     The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     The king! why, who's that?
BRAKENBURY
     I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
     Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
     I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
LADY ANNE
     Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
     Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
     And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
BRAKENBURY
     No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
     I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
     Exit
     Enter LORD STANLEY
LORD STANLEY
     Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
     And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
     And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
     To LADY ANNE
     Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
     There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
     May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
     With this dead-killing news!
LADY ANNE
     Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
DORSET
     Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
     Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
     Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
     If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
     And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
     Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
     Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
     And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
     Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
LORD STANLEY
     Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
     Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
     You shall have letters from me to my son
     To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
     Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
     O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
     A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
     Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
LORD STANLEY
     Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
LADY ANNE
     And I in all unwillingness will go.
     I would to God that the inclusive verge
     Of golden metal that must round my brow
     Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
     Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
     And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
     To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
LADY ANNE
     No! why? When he that is my husband now
     Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
     When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
     Which issued from my other angel husband
     And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
     O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
     This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
     For making me, so young, so old a widow!
     And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
     And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
     As miserable by the life of thee
     As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
     Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
     Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
     Grossly grew captive to his honey words
     And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
     Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
     For never yet one hour in his bed
     Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
     But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
     Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
     And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
LADY ANNE
     No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
LADY ANNE
     Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
DUCHESS OF YORK
     [To DORSET]
     Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
     To LADY ANNE
     Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
     To QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
     I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
     Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
     And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
     Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
     Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
     Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
     Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
     For tender princes, use my babies well!
     So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. The palace. ****
     Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III, in pomp, crowned; BUCKINGHAM,
     CATESBY, a page, and others
KING RICHARD III
     Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
BUCKINGHAM
     My gracious sovereign?
KING RICHARD III
     Give me thy hand.
     Here he ascendeth his throne
     Thus high, by thy advice
     And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
     But shall we wear these honours for a day?
     Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
BUCKINGHAM
     Still live they and for ever may they last!
KING RICHARD III
     O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
     To try if thou be current gold indeed
     Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
BUCKINGHAM
     Say on, my loving lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
BUCKINGHAM
     Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
KING RICHARD III
     Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
BUCKINGHAM
     True, noble prince.
KING RICHARD III
     O bitter consequence,
     That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
     Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
     Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
     And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
     What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
BUCKINGHAM
     Your grace may do your pleasure.
KING RICHARD III
     Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
     Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
BUCKINGHAM
     Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
     Before I positively herein:
     I will resolve your grace immediately.
     Exit
CATESBY
     [Aside to a stander by]
     The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
KING RICHARD III
     I will converse with iron-witted fools
     And unrespective boys: none are for me
     That look into me with considerate eyes:
     High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
     Boy!
Page
     My lord?
KING RICHARD III
     Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
     Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
Page
     My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
     Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
     Gold were as good as twenty orators,
     And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
KING RICHARD III
     What is his name?
Page
     His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
KING RICHARD III
     I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
     Exit Page
     The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
     No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
     Hath he so long held out with me untired,
     And stops he now for breath?
     Enter STANLEY
     How now! what news with you?
STANLEY
     My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
     To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
     Where he abides.
     Stands apart
KING RICHARD III
     Catesby!
CATESBY
     My lord?
KING RICHARD III
     Rumour it abroad
     That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
     I will take order for her keeping close.
     Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
     Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
     The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
     Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
     That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
     About it; for it stands me much upon,
     To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
     Exit CATESBY
     I must be married to my brother's daughter,
     Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
     Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
     Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
     So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
     Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
     Re-enter Page, with TYRREL
     Is thy name Tyrrel?
TYRREL
     James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
KING RICHARD III
     Art thou, indeed?
TYRREL
     Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
KING RICHARD III
     Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
TYRREL
     Ay, my lord;
     But I had rather kill two enemies.
KING RICHARD III
     Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
     Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
     Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
     Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
TYRREL
     Let me have open means to come to them,
     And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
KING RICHARD III
     Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
     Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
     Whispers
     There is no more but so: say it is done,
     And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
TYRREL
     'Tis done, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
TYRREL
     Ye shall, my Lord.
     Exit
     Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM
     My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
     The late demand that you did sound me in.
KING RICHARD III
     Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
BUCKINGHAM
     I hear that news, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
BUCKINGHAM
     My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
     For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
     The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
     The which you promised I should possess.
KING RICHARD III
     Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
     Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
BUCKINGHAM
     What says your highness to my just demand?
KING RICHARD III
     As I remember, Henry the Sixth
     Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
     When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
     A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
BUCKINGHAM
     My lord!
KING RICHARD III
     How chance the prophet could not at that time
     Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
BUCKINGHAM
     My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
KING RICHARD III
     Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
     The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
     And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
     Because a bard of Ireland told me once
     I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
BUCKINGHAM
     My Lord!
KING RICHARD III
     Ay, what's o'clock?
BUCKINGHAM
     I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
     Of what you promised me.
KING RICHARD III
     Well, but what's o'clock?
BUCKINGHAM
     Upon the stroke of ten.
KING RICHARD III
     Well, let it strike.
BUCKINGHAM
     Why let it strike?
KING RICHARD III
     Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
     Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
     I am not in the giving vein to-day.
BUCKINGHAM
     Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
KING RICHARD III
     Tut, tut,
     Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
     Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM
     Is it even so? rewards he my true service
     With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
     O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
     To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
     Exit
**** SCENE III. The same. ****
     Enter TYRREL
TYRREL
     The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
     The most arch of piteous massacre
     That ever yet this land was guilty of.
     Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
     To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
     Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
     Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
     Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
     'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
     'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
     Within their innocent alabaster arms:
     Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
     Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
     A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
     Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
     But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
     Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
     The most replenished sweet work of nature,
     That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
     Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
     They could not speak; and so I left them both,
     To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
     And here he comes.
     Enter KING RICHARD III
     All hail, my sovereign liege!
KING RICHARD III
     Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
TYRREL
     If to have done the thing you gave in charge
     Beget your happiness, be happy then,
     For it is done, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     But didst thou see them dead?
TYRREL
     I did, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
TYRREL
     The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
     But how or in what place I do not know.
KING RICHARD III
     Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
     And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
     Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
     And be inheritor of thy desire.
     Farewell till soon.
     Exit TYRREL
     The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
     His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
     The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
     And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
     Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
     At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
     And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
     To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
     Enter CATESBY
CATESBY
     My lord!
KING RICHARD III
     Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
CATESBY
     Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
     And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
     Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
KING RICHARD III
     Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
     Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
     Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
     Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
     Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
     Then fiery expedition be my wing,
     Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
     Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
     We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Before the palace. ****
     Enter QUEEN MARGARET
QUEEN MARGARET
     So, now prosperity begins to mellow
     And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
     Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
     To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
     A dire induction am I witness to,
     And will to France, hoping the consequence
     Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
     Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
     Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
     My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
     If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
     And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
     Hover about me with your airy wings
     And hear your mother's lamentation!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Hover about her; say, that right for right
     Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     So many miseries have crazed my voice,
     That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
     Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
     Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
     And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
     When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
QUEEN MARGARET
     When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
     Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
     Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
     Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
     Sitting down
     Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
     As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
     Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
     O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
     Sitting down by her
QUEEN MARGARET
     If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
     Give mine the benefit of seniory,
     And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
     If sorrow can admit society,
     Sitting down with them
     Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
     I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
     I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
     Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
     Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
     I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
     From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
     A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
     That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
     To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
     That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
     That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
     That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
     Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
     O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
     How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
     Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
     And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
DUCHESS OF YORK
     O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
     God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
     And now I cloy me with beholding it.
     Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
     Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
     Young York he is but boot, because both they
     Match not the high perfection of my loss:
     Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
     And the beholders of this tragic play,
     The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
     Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
     Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
     Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
     And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
     Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
     Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
     To have him suddenly convey'd away.
     Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
     That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
     That I should wish for thee to help me curse
     That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
QUEEN MARGARET
     I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
     I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
     The presentation of but what I was;
     The flattering index of a direful pageant;
     One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
     A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
     A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
     A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
     To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
     A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
     Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
     Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
     Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
     Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
     Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
     Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
     For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
     For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
     For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
     For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
     For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
     For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
     For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
     Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
     And left thee but a very prey to time;
     Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
     To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
     Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
     Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
     Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
     From which even here I slip my weary neck,
     And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
     Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
     These English woes will make me smile in France.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
     And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
     Compare dead happiness with living woe;
     Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
     And he that slew them fouler than he is:
     Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
     Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
     Exit
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Why should calamity be full of words?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Windy attorneys to their client woes,
     Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
     Poor breathing orators of miseries!
     Let them have scope: though what they do impart
     Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
     And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
     My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
     I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
     Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets
KING RICHARD III
     Who intercepts my expedition?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     O, she that might have intercepted thee,
     By strangling thee in her accursed womb
     From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
     Where should be graven, if that right were right,
     The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
     And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
     Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
     And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
KING RICHARD III
     A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
     Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
     Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
     Flourish. Alarums
     Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
     Or with the clamorous report of war
     Thus will I drown your exclamations.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Art thou my son?
KING RICHARD III
     Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Then patiently hear my impatience.
KING RICHARD III
     Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
     Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     O, let me speak!
KING RICHARD III
     Do then: but I'll not hear.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
KING RICHARD III
     And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
     God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
KING RICHARD III
     And came I not at last to comfort you?
DUCHESS OF YORK
     No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
     Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
     A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
     Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
     Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
     Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
     Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
     treacherous,
     More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
     What comfortable hour canst thou name,
     That ever graced me in thy company?
KING RICHARD III
     Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
     your grace
     To breakfast once forth of my company.
     If I be so disgracious in your sight,
     Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
     Strike the drum.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     I prithee, hear me speak.
KING RICHARD III
     You speak too bitterly.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Hear me a word;
     For I shall never speak to thee again.
KING RICHARD III
     So.
DUCHESS OF YORK
     Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
     Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
     Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
     And never look upon thy face again.
     Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
     Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
     Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
     My prayers on the adverse party fight;
     And there the little souls of Edward's children
     Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
     And promise them success and victory.
     Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
     Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
     Exit
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
     Abides in me; I say amen to all.
KING RICHARD III
     Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     I have no more sons of the royal blood
     For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
     They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
     And therefore level not to hit their lives.
KING RICHARD III
     You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
     Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     And must she die for this? O, let her live,
     And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
     Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
     Throw over her the veil of infamy:
     So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
     I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
KING RICHARD III
     Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
KING RICHARD III
     Her life is only safest in her birth.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     And only in that safety died her brothers.
KING RICHARD III
     Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
KING RICHARD III
     All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
     My babes were destined to a fairer death,
     If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
KING RICHARD III
     You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
     Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
     Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
     Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
     No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
     Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
     To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
     But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
     My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
     Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
     And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
     Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
     Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
KING RICHARD III
     Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
     And dangerous success of bloody wars,
     As I intend more good to you and yours,
     Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
     To be discover'd, that can do me good?
KING RICHARD III
     The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
KING RICHARD III
     No, to the dignity and height of honour
     The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
     Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
     Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
KING RICHARD III
     Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
     Will I withal endow a child of thine;
     So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
     Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
     Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
     Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
KING RICHARD III
     Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
KING RICHARD III
     What do you think?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
     So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
     And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
KING RICHARD III
     Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
     I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
     And mean to make her queen of England.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
KING RICHARD III
     Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     What, thou?
KING RICHARD III
     I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     How canst thou woo her?
KING RICHARD III
     That would I learn of you,
     As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     And wilt thou learn of me?
KING RICHARD III
     Madam, with all my heart.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
     A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
     Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
     Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
     Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
     A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
     The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
     And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
     If this inducement force her not to love,
     Send her a story of thy noble acts;
     Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
     Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
     Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
KING RICHARD III
     Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
     To win our daughter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     There is no other way
     Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
     And not be Richard that hath done all this.
KING RICHARD III
     Say that I did all this for love of her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
     Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
KING RICHARD III
     Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
     Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
     Which after hours give leisure to repent.
     If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
     To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
     If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
     To quicken your increase, I will beget
     Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
     A grandam's name is little less in love
     Than is the doting title of a mother;
     They are as children but one step below,
     Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
     Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
     Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
     Your children were vexation to your youth,
     But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
     The loss you have is but a son being king,
     And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
     I cannot make you what amends I would,
     Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
     Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
     Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
     This fair alliance quickly shall call home
     To high promotions and great dignity:
     The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
     Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
     Again shall you be mother to a king,
     And all the ruins of distressful times
     Repair'd with double riches of content.
     What! we have many goodly days to see:
     The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
     Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
     Advantaging their loan with interest
     Of ten times double gain of happiness.
     Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
     Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
     Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
     Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
     Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
     With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
     And when this arm of mine hath chastised
     The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
     Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
     And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
     To whom I will retail my conquest won,
     And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     What were I best to say? her father's brother
     Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
     Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
     Under what title shall I woo for thee,
     That God, the law, my honour and her love,
     Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
KING RICHARD III
     Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
KING RICHARD III
     Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
KING RICHARD III
     Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
KING RICHARD III
     Say, I will love her everlastingly.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
KING RICHARD III
     Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
KING RICHARD III
     So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
KING RICHARD III
     Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
KING RICHARD III
     Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
KING RICHARD III
     Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
KING RICHARD III
     Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
     Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
KING RICHARD III
     Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
KING RICHARD III
     Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
KING RICHARD III
     I swear--
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     By nothing; for this is no oath:
     The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
     The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
     The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
     if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
     Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
KING RICHARD III
     Now, by the world--
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
KING RICHARD III
     My father's death--
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
KING RICHARD III
     Then, by myself--
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Thyself thyself misusest.
KING RICHARD III
     Why then, by God--
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     God's wrong is most of all.
     If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
     The unity the king thy brother made
     Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
     If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
     The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
     Had graced the tender temples of my child,
     And both the princes had been breathing here,
     Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
     Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
     What canst thou swear by now?
KING RICHARD III
     The time to come.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
     For I myself have many tears to wash
     Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
     The children live, whose parents thou hast
     slaughter'd,
     Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
     The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
     Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
     Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
     Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
KING RICHARD III
     As I intend to prosper and repent,
     So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
     Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
     Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
     Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
     Be opposite all planets of good luck
     To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
     Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
     I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
     In her consists my happiness and thine;
     Without her, follows to this land and me,
     To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
     Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
     It cannot be avoided but by this;
     It will not be avoided but by this.
     Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
     Be the attorney of my love to her:
     Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
     Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
     Urge the necessity and state of times,
     And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
KING RICHARD III
     Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Shall I forget myself to be myself?
KING RICHARD III
     Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     But thou didst kill my children.
KING RICHARD III
     But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
     Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
     Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
KING RICHARD III
     And be a happy mother by the deed.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     I go. Write to me very shortly.
     And you shall understand from me her mind.
KING RICHARD III
     Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
     Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
     Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following
     How now! what news?
RATCLIFF
     My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
     Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
     Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
     Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
     'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
     And there they hull, expecting but the aid
     Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
KING RICHARD III
     Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
     Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
CATESBY
     Here, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Fly to the duke:
     To RATCLIFF
     Post thou to Salisbury
     When thou comest thither--
     To CATESBY
     Dull, unmindful villain,
     Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
CATESBY
     First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
     What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
KING RICHARD III
     O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
     The greatest strength and power he can make,
     And meet me presently at Salisbury.
CATESBY
     I go.
     Exit
RATCLIFF
     What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
     Salisbury?
KING RICHARD III
     Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
RATCLIFF
     Your highness told me I should post before.
KING RICHARD III
     My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
     Enter STANLEY
     How now, what news with you?
STANLEY
     None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
     Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
KING RICHARD III
     Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
     Why dost thou run so many mile about,
     When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
     Once more, what news?
STANLEY
     Richmond is on the seas.
KING RICHARD III
     There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
     White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
STANLEY
     I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
KING RICHARD III
     Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
STANLEY
     Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
     He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
KING RICHARD III
     Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
     Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
     What heir of York is there alive but we?
     And who is England's king but great York's heir?
     Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
STANLEY
     Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
KING RICHARD III
     Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
     You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
     Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
STANLEY
     No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
KING RICHARD III
     Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
     Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
     Are they not now upon the western shore.
     Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
STANLEY
     No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
KING RICHARD III
     Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
     When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
STANLEY
     They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
     Please it your majesty to give me leave,
     I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
     Where and what time your majesty shall please.
KING RICHARD III
     Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
     I will not trust you, sir.
STANLEY
     Most mighty sovereign,
     You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
     I never was nor never will be false.
KING RICHARD III
     Well,
     Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
     Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
     Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
STANLEY
     So deal with him as I prove true to you.

     My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
     As I by friends am well advertised,
     Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
     Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
     With many more confederates, are in arms.

Second Messenger
     My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
     And every hour more competitors
     Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.

Third Messenger
     My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
KING RICHARD III
     Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
     He striketh him
     Take that, until thou bring me better news.
Third Messenger
     The news I have to tell your majesty
     Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
     Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
     And he himself wander'd away alone,
     No man knows whither.
KING RICHARD III
     I cry thee mercy:
     There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
     Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
     Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
Third Messenger
     Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
     Enter another Messenger
Fourth Messenger
     Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
     'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
     Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
     The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
     Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
     Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
     If they were his assistants, yea or no;
     Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
     Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
     Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
KING RICHARD III
     March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
     If not to fight with foreign enemies,
     Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
     Re-enter CATESBY
CATESBY
     My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
     That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
     Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
     Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
KING RICHARD III
     Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
     A royal battle might be won and lost
     Some one take order Buckingham be brought
     To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
     Flourish. Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Lord Derby's house. ****
     Enter DERBY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK
DERBY
     Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
     That in the sty of this most bloody boar
     My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
     If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
     The fear of that withholds my present aid.
     But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
CHRISTOPHER
     At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
DERBY
     What men of name resort to him?
CHRISTOPHER
     Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
     Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
     Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
     And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
     And many more of noble fame and worth:
     And towards London they do bend their course,
     If by the way they be not fought withal.
DERBY
     Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
     Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
     He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
     These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.
     Exeunt
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. Salisbury. An open place. ****
     Enter the Sheriff, and BUCKINGHAM, with halberds, led to execution
BUCKINGHAM
     Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
Sheriff
     No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
BUCKINGHAM
     Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
     Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
     Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
     By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
     If that your moody discontented souls
     Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
     Even for revenge mock my destruction!
     This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
Sheriff
     It is, my lord.
BUCKINGHAM
     Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
     This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
     I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
     False to his children or his wife's allies
     This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
     By the false faith of him I trusted most;
     This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
     Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
     That high All-Seer that I dallied with
     Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
     And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
     Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
     To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
     Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
     'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
     Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
     Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
     Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The camp near Tamworth. ****
     Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, BLUNT, HERBERT, and others, with drum and
     colours
RICHMOND
     Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
     Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
     Thus far into the bowels of the land
     Have we march'd on without impediment;
     And here receive we from our father Stanley
     Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
     The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
     That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
     Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
     In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
     Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
     Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
     From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
     In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
     To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
     By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
OXFORD
     Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
     To fight against that bloody homicide.
HERBERT
     I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
BLUNT
     He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
     Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
RICHMOND
     All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
     True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
     Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

**** SCENE III. Bosworth Field. ****
     Enter KING RICHARD III in arms, with NORFOLK, SURREY, and others
KING RICHARD III
     Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
     My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
SURREY
     My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
KING RICHARD III
     My Lord of Norfolk,--
NORFOLK
     Here, most gracious liege.
KING RICHARD III
     Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
NORFOLK
     We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
     But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
     Who hath descried the number of the foe?
NORFOLK
     Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
KING RICHARD III
     Why, our battalion trebles that account:
     Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
     Which they upon the adverse party want.
     Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
     Let us survey the vantage of the field
     Call for some men of sound direction
     Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
     For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
     Exeunt
     Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND, Sir William Brandon,
     OXFORD, and others. Some of the Soldiers pitch RICHMOND's tent
RICHMOND
     The weary sun hath made a golden set,
     And by the bright track of his fiery car,
     Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
     Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
     Give me some ink and paper in my tent
     I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
     Limit each leader to his several charge,
     And part in just proportion our small strength.
     My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
     And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
     The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
     Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
     And by the second hour in the morning
     Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
     Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
     Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
BLUNT
     Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
     Which well I am assured I have not done,
     His regiment lies half a mile at least
     South from the mighty power of the king.
RICHMOND
     If without peril it be possible,
     Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
     And give him from me this most needful scroll.
BLUNT
     Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
     And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
RICHMOND
     Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
     Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
     In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
     They withdraw into the tent
     Enter, to his tent, KING RICHARD III, NORFOLK, RATCLIFF, CATESBY, and
     others
KING RICHARD III
     What is't o'clock?
CATESBY
     It's supper-time, my lord;
     It's nine o'clock.
KING RICHARD III
     I will not sup to-night.
     Give me some ink and paper.
     What, is my beaver easier than it was?
     And all my armour laid into my tent?
CATESBY
     If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
KING RICHARD III
     Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
     Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
NORFOLK
     I go, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
NORFOLK
     I warrant you, my lord.
     Exit
KING RICHARD III
     Catesby!
CATESBY
     My lord?
KING RICHARD III
     Send out a pursuivant at arms
     To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
     Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
     Into the blind cave of eternal night.
     Exit CATESBY
     Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
     Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
     Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
     Ratcliff!
RATCLIFF
     My lord?
KING RICHARD III
     Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
RATCLIFF
     Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
     Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
     Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
KING RICHARD III
     So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
     I have not that alacrity of spirit,
     Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
     Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
RATCLIFF
     It is, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Bid my guard watch; leave me.
     Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
     And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
     Exeunt RATCLIFF and the other Attendants
     Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent, Lords and others attending
DERBY
     Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
RICHMOND
     All comfort that the dark night can afford
     Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
     Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
DERBY
     I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
     Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
     So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
     And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
     In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
     Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
     And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
     Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
     I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
     With best advantage will deceive the time,
     And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
     But on thy side I may not be too forward
     Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
     Be executed in his father's sight.
     Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
     Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
     And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
     Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
     God give us leisure for these rites of love!
     Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
RICHMOND
     Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
     I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
     Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
     When I should mount with wings of victory:
     Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
     Exeunt all but RICHMOND
     O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
     Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
     Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
     That they may crush down with a heavy fall
     The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
     Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
     That we may praise thee in the victory!
     To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
     Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
     Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

     To-morrow in the battle think on me,
     And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--

     The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee
     Good angels guard thy battle! live, and flourish!

     Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
     Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!
     Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes

     Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die!
     To RICHMOND
     Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;

     Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
     Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

     To RICHMOND
     Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep
     Dream of success and happy victory!
     Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

     Ghost
of BUCKINGHAM

     The last was I that helped thee to the crown;
     The last was I that felt thy tyranny:

     And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
     Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:
     Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
     To RICHMOND
     I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
     But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:
     God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;
     And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
     The Ghosts vanish
     KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream
KING RICHARD III
     Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
     Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
     O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
     The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
     Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
     What do I fear? myself? there's none else by:
     Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
     Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
     Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:
     Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
     Alack. I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
     That I myself have done unto myself?
     O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
     For hateful deeds committed by myself!
     I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
     Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
     My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
     And every tongue brings in a several tale,
     And every tale condemns me for a villain.
     Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
     Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
     All several sins, all used in each degree,
     Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
     I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
     And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
     Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
     Find in myself no pity to myself?
     Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
     Came to my tent; and every one did threat
     To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
     Enter RATCLIFF
RATCLIFF
     My lord!
KING RICHARD III
     'Zounds! who is there?
RATCLIFF
     Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
     Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
     Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
KING RICHARD III
     O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
     What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
RATCLIFF
     No doubt, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
RATCLIFF
     Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
KING RICHARD III
     By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
     Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
     Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
     Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
     It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
     Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
     To see if any mean to shrink from me.
     Exeunt
     Enter the Lords to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent
LORDS
     Good morrow, Richmond!
RICHMOND
     Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
     That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
LORDS
     How have you slept, my lord?
RICHMOND
     The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
     That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
     Have I since your departure had, my lords.
     Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
     Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
     I promise you, my soul is very jocund
     In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
     How far into the morning is it, lords?
LORDS
     Upon the stroke of four.
RICHMOND
     Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
     His oration to his soldiers
     More than I have said, loving countrymen,
     The leisure and enforcement of the time
     Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
     God and our good cause fight upon our side;
     The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
     Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
     Richard except, those whom we fight against
     Had rather have us win than him they follow:
     For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,
     A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
     One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
     One that made means to come by what he hath,
     And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
     Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
     Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
     One that hath ever been God's enemy:
     Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
     God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
     If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
     You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
     If you do fight against your country's foes,
     Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
     If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
     Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
     If you do free your children from the sword,
     Your children's children quit it in your age.
     Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
     Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
     For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
     Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
     But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
     The least of you shall share his part thereof.
     Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
     God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
     Exeunt
     Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, Attendants and Forces
KING RICHARD III
     What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
RATCLIFF
     That he was never trained up in arms.
KING RICHARD III
     He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
RATCLIFF
     He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
KING RICHARD III
     He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
     Clock striketh
     Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
     Who saw the sun to-day?
RATCLIFF
     Not I, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
     Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
     He should have braved the east an hour ago
     A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
RATCLIFF
     My lord?
KING RICHARD III
     The sun will not be seen to-day;
     The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
     I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
     Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
     More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven
     That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
     Enter NORFOLK
NORFOLK
     Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
KING RICHARD III
     Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
     Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
     I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
     And thus my battle shall be ordered:
     My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
     Consisting equally of horse and foot;
     Our archers shall be placed in the midst
     John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
     Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
     They thus directed, we will follow
     In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
     Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
     This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
NORFOLK
     A good direction, warlike sovereign.
     This found I on my tent this morning.
     He sheweth him a paper
KING RICHARD III
     [Reads]
     'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
     For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
     A thing devised by the enemy.
     Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge
     Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
     Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
     Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
     Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
     March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell
     If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
     His oration to his Army
     What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
     Remember whom you are to cope withal;
     A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
     A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
     Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
     To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
     You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
     You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
     They would restrain the one, distain the other.
     And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
     Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
     A milk-sop, one that never in his life
     Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
     Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
     Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
     These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
     Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
     For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
     If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
     And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
     Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
     And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
     Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
     Ravish our daughters?
     Drum afar off
     Hark! I hear their drum.
     Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!
     Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
     Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
     Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
     Enter a Messenger
     What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
Messenger
     My lord, he doth deny to come.
KING RICHARD III
     Off with his son George's head!
NORFOLK
     My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
     After the battle let George Stanley die.
KING RICHARD III
     A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
     Advance our standards, set upon our foes
     Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
     Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
     Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Another part of the field. ****
     Alarum: excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces fighting; to him CATESBY
CATESBY
     Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
     The king enacts more wonders than a man,
     Daring an opposite to every danger:
     His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
     Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
     Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
     Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III
KING RICHARD III
     A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
CATESBY
     Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
KING RICHARD III
     Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
     And I will stand the hazard of the die:
     I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
     Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
     A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Another part of the field. ****
     Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND; they fight. KING RICHARD
     III is slain. Retreat and flourish. Re-enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing
     the crown, with divers other Lords
RICHMOND
     God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
     The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
DERBY
     Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
     Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
     From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
     Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
     Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
RICHMOND
     Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
     But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
DERBY
     He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
     Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
RICHMOND
     What men of name are slain on either side?
DERBY
     John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
     Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
RICHMOND
     Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
     Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
     That in submission will return to us:
     And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
     We will unite the white rose and the red:
     Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
     That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
     What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
     England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
     The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
     The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
     The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
     All this divided York and Lancaster,
     Divided in their dire division,
     O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
     The true succeeders of each royal house,
     By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
     And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
     Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
     With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
     Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
     That would reduce these bloody days again,
     And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
     Let them not live to taste this land's increase
     That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
     Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
     That she may long live here, God say amen!

The Comedy of Errors
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace. ****
     Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants
AEGEON
     Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
     And by the doom of death end woes and all.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
     I am not partial to infringe our laws:
     The enmity and discord which of late
     Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
     To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
     Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
     Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
     Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
     For, since the mortal and intestine jars
     'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
     It hath in solemn synods been decreed
     Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
     To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
     If any born at Ephesus be seen
     At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
     Again: if any Syracusian born
     Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
     His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
     Unless a thousand marks be levied,
     To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
     Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
     Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
     Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
AEGEON
     Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
     My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
     Why thou departed'st from thy native home
     And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
AEGEON
     A heavier task could not have been imposed
     Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
     Yet, that the world may witness that my end
     Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
     I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
     In Syracusa was I born, and wed
     Unto a woman, happy but for me,
     And by me, had not our hap been bad.
     With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
     By prosperous voyages I often made
     To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
     And the great care of goods at random left
     Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
     From whom my absence was not six months old
     Before herself, almost at fainting under
     The pleasing punishment that women bear,
     Had made provision for her following me
     And soon and safe arrived where I was.
     There had she not been long, but she became
     A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
     And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
     As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
     That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
     A meaner woman was delivered
     Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
     Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
     I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
     My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
     Made daily motions for our home return:
     Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
     We came aboard.
     A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
     Before the always wind-obeying deep
     Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
     But longer did we not retain much hope;
     For what obscured light the heavens did grant
     Did but convey unto our fearful minds
     A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
     Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
     Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
     Weeping before for what she saw must come,
     And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
     That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
     Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
     And this it was, for other means was none:
     The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
     And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
     My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
     Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
     Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
     To him one of the other twins was bound,
     Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
     The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
     Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
     Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
     And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
     Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
     At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
     Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
     And by the benefit of his wished light,
     The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
     Two ships from far making amain to us,
     Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
     But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
     Gather the sequel by that went before.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
     For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
AEGEON
     O, had the gods done so, I had not now
     Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
     For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
     We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
     Which being violently borne upon,
     Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
     So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
     Fortune had left to both of us alike
     What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
     Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
     With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
     Was carried with more speed before the wind;
     And in our sight they three were taken up
     By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
     At length, another ship had seized on us;
     And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
     Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
     And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
     Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
     And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
     Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
     That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
     To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
DUKE SOLINUS
     And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
     Do me the favour to dilate at full
     What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
AEGEON
     My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
     At eighteen years became inquisitive
     After his brother: and importuned me
     That his attendant--so his case was like,
     Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
     Might bear him company in the quest of him:
     Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
     I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
     Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
     Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
     And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
     Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
     Or that or any place that harbours men.
     But here must end the story of my life;
     And happy were I in my timely death,
     Could all my travels warrant me they live.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
     To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
     Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
     Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
     Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
     My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
     But, though thou art adjudged to the death
     And passed sentence may not be recall'd
     But to our honour's great disparagement,
     Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
     Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
     To seek thy life by beneficial help:
     Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
     Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
     And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
     Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
Gaoler
     I will, my lord.
AEGEON
     Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
     But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The Mart. ****
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant
First Merchant
     Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
     Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
     This very day a Syracusian merchant
     Is apprehended for arrival here;
     And not being able to buy out his life
     According to the statute of the town,
     Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
     There is your money that I had to keep.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
     And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
     Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
     Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
     Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
     And then return and sleep within mine inn,
     For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
     Get thee away.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Many a man would take you at your word,
     And go indeed, having so good a mean.
     Exit
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
     When I am dull with care and melancholy,
     Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
     What, will you walk with me about the town,
     And then go to my inn and dine with me?
First Merchant
     I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
     Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
     I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
     Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
     And afterward consort you till bed-time:
     My present business calls me from you now.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
     And wander up and down to view the city.
First Merchant
     Sir, I commend you to your own content.
     Exit
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     He that commends me to mine own content
     Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
     I to the world am like a drop of water
     That in the ocean seeks another drop,
     Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
     Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
     So I, to find a mother and a brother,
     In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
     Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
     Here comes the almanac of my true date.
     What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
     The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
     The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
     My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
     She is so hot because the meat is cold;
     The meat is cold because you come not home;
     You come not home because you have no stomach;
     You have no stomach having broke your fast;
     But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
     Are penitent for your default to-day.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
     Where have you left the money that I gave you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
     To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
     The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I am not in a sportive humour now:
     Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
     We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
     So great a charge from thine own custody?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
     I from my mistress come to you in post;
     If I return, I shall be post indeed,
     For she will score your fault upon my pate.
     Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
     And strike you home without a messenger.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
     Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
     Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
     And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
     Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
     My mistress and her sister stays for you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
     Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
     That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
     Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
     Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
     But not a thousand marks between you both.
     If I should pay your worship those again,
     Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
     She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
     And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
     Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
     Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
     Exit
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Upon my life, by some device or other
     The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
     They say this town is full of cozenage,
     As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
     Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
     Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
     Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
     And many such-like liberties of sin:
     If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
     I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
     I greatly fear my money is not safe.
     Exit
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. ****
     Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA
     Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
     That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
     Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
LUCIANA
     Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
     And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
     Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
     A man is master of his liberty:
     Time is their master, and, when they see time,
     They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
ADRIANA
     Why should their liberty than ours be more?
LUCIANA
     Because their business still lies out o' door.
ADRIANA
     Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
LUCIANA
     O, know he is the bridle of your will.
ADRIANA
     There's none but asses will be bridled so.
LUCIANA
     Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
     There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
     But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
     The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
     Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
     Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
     Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
     Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
     Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
     Are masters to their females, and their lords:
     Then let your will attend on their accords.
ADRIANA
     This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
LUCIANA
     Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
ADRIANA
     But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
LUCIANA
     Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
ADRIANA
     How if your husband start some other where?
LUCIANA
     Till he come home again, I would forbear.
ADRIANA
     Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
     They can be meek that have no other cause.
     A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
     We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
     But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
     As much or more would we ourselves complain:
     So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
     With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
     But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
     This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
LUCIANA
     Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
     Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
     Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
ADRIANA
     Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
     can witness.
ADRIANA
     Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
     Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
LUCIANA
     Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
     blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
     understand them.
ADRIANA
     But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
     hath great care to please his wife.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
ADRIANA
     Horn-mad, thou villain!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I mean not cuckold-mad;
     But, sure, he is stark mad.
     When I desired him to come home to dinner,
     He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
     ''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
     'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
     'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
     'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
     'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
     'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
     I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'
LUCIANA
     Quoth who?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Quoth my master:
     'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
     So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
     I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
     For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
ADRIANA
     Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Go back again, and be new beaten home?
     For God's sake, send some other messenger.
ADRIANA
     Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     And he will bless that cross with other beating:
     Between you I shall have a holy head.
ADRIANA
     Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Am I so round with you as you with me,
     That like a football you do spurn me thus?
     You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
     If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
     Exit
LUCIANA
     Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
ADRIANA
     His company must do his minions grace,
     Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
     Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
     From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
     Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
     If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
     Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
     Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
     That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
     What ruins are in me that can be found,
     By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
     Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
     A sunny look of his would soon repair
     But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
     And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
LUCIANA
     Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!
ADRIANA
     Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
     I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
     Or else what lets it but he would be here?
     Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
     Would that alone, alone he would detain,
     So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
     I see the jewel best enamelled
     Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
     That others touch, and often touching will
     Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
     By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
     Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
     I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
LUCIANA
     How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A public place. ****
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
     Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
     Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
     By computation and mine host's report.
     I could not speak with Dromio since at first
     I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
     Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
     How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
     As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
     You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
     Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
     My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
     That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I did not see you since you sent me hence,
     Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
     And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
     For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
     What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
     Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
     Beating him
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
     Upon what bargain do you give it me?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Because that I familiarly sometimes
     Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
     Your sauciness will jest upon my love
     And make a common of my serious hours.
     When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
     But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
     If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
     And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
     Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
     had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
     long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
     it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
     But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Dost thou not know?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Shall I tell you why?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
     a wherefore.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
     For urging it the second time to me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
     When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
     nor reason?
     Well, sir, I thank you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Thank me, sir, for what?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
     something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     In good time, sir; what's that?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Basting.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Your reason?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
     dry basting.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
     time for all things.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     By what rule, sir?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
     pate of father Time himself.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Let's hear it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
     grows bald by nature.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     May he not do it by fine and recovery?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
     lost hair of another man.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
     so plentiful an excrement?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
     and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
     it in a kind of jollity.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     For what reason?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     For two; and sound ones too.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Nay, not sound, I pray you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Sure ones, then.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Certain ones then.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Name them.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     The one, to save the money that he spends in
     trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
     drop in his porridge.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     You would all this time have proved there is no
     time for all things.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
     lost by nature.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
     time to recover.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
     to the world's end will have bald followers.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
     But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
     Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA
     Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
     Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
     I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
     The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
     That never words were music to thine ear,
     That never object pleasing in thine eye,
     That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
     That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
     Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
     How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
     That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
     Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
     That, undividable, incorporate,
     Am better than thy dear self's better part.
     Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
     For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
     A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
     And take unmingled that same drop again,
     Without addition or diminishing,
     As take from me thyself and not me too.
     How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
     Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
     And that this body, consecrate to thee,
     By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
     Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
     And hurl the name of husband in my face
     And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
     And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
     And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
     I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
     I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
     My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
     For if we too be one and thou play false,
     I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
     Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
     Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
     I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
     In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
     As strange unto your town as to your talk;
     Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
     Want wit in all one word to understand.
LUCIANA
     Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
     When were you wont to use my sister thus?
     She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     By Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     By me?
ADRIANA
     By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
     That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
     Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
     What is the course and drift of your compact?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
     Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I never spake with her in all my life.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     How can she thus then call us by our names,
     Unless it be by inspiration.
ADRIANA
     How ill agrees it with your gravity
     To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
     Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
     Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
     But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
     Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
     Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
     Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
     Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
     If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
     Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
     Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
     Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
     What, was I married to her in my dream?
     Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
     What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
     Until I know this sure uncertainty,
     I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
LUCIANA
     Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
     This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
     We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
     If we obey them not, this will ensue,
     They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
LUCIANA
     Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
     Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I am transformed, master, am I not?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Thou hast thine own form.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No, I am an ape.
LUCIANA
     If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
     'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
     But I should know her as well as she knows me.
ADRIANA
     Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
     To put the finger in the eye and weep,
     Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
     Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
     Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
     And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
     Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
     Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
     Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
     Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
     Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
     I'll say as they say and persever so,
     And in this mist at all adventures go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
ADRIANA
     Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
LUCIANA
     Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. ****
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
     My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
     Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
     To see the making of her carcanet,
     And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
     But here's a villain that would face me down
     He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
     And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
     And that I did deny my wife and house.
     Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
     That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
     If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
     Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I think thou art an ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Marry, so it doth appear
     By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
     I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
     You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
     May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
BALTHAZAR
     I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
     welcome dear.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
     A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
BALTHAZAR
     Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
BALTHAZAR
     Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
     But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
     Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
     But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
     idiot, patch!
     Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
     Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
     for such store,
     When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
     the street.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
     catch cold on's feet.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Who talks within there? ho, open the door!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
     me wherefore.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
     when you may.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name
     is Dromio.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
     The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
     If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
     Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
     name for an ass.
LUCE
     [Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
     at the gate?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Let my master in, Luce.
LUCE
     [Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;
     And so tell your master.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     O Lord, I must laugh!
     Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
LUCE
     [Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?
     can you tell?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
     answered him well.
ANTIPHOLUS
     Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
     OF EPHESUS
LUCE
     [Within] I thought to have asked you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] And you said no.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Thou baggage, let me in.
LUCE
     [Within] Can you tell for whose sake?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Master, knock the door hard.
LUCE
     [Within] Let him knock till it ache.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
LUCE
     [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
ADRIANA
     [Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all
     this noise?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with
     unruly boys.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
ADRIANA
     [Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
ANGELO
     Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
     fain have either.
BALTHAZAR
     In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
     Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
     It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
     knave's pate.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
     Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
     thee, hind!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
     let me in.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     [Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
     For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
     If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
BALTHAZAR
     Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
     Herein you war against your reputation
     And draw within the compass of suspect
     The unviolated honour of your wife.
     Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
     Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
     Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
     And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
     Why at this time the doors are made against you.
     Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
     And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
     And about evening come yourself alone
     To know the reason of this strange restraint.
     If by strong hand you offer to break in
     Now in the stirring passage of the day,
     A vulgar comment will be made of it,
     And that supposed by the common rout
     Against your yet ungalled estimation
     That may with foul intrusion enter in
     And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
     For slander lives upon succession,
     For ever housed where it gets possession.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
     And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
     I know a wench of excellent discourse,
     Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
     There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
     My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
     Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
     To her will we to dinner.
     To Angelo
     Get you home
     And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
     Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
     For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
     Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
     Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
     Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
     I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
ANGELO
     I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The same. ****
     Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
LUCIANA
     And may it be that you have quite forgot
     A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
     Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
     Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
     If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
     Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
     Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
     Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
     Let not my sister read it in your eye;
     Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
     Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
     Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
     Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
     Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
     Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
     What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
     'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
     And let her read it in thy looks at board:
     Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
     Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
     Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
     Being compact of credit, that you love us;
     Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
     We in your motion turn and you may move us.
     Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
     Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
     'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
     When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
     Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
     Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
     Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
     Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
     Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
     Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
     The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
     Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
     To make it wander in an unknown field?
     Are you a god? would you create me new?
     Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
     But if that I am I, then well I know
     Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
     Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
     Far more, far more to you do I decline.
     O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
     To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
     Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
     Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
     And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
     And in that glorious supposition think
     He gains by death that hath such means to die:
     Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
LUCIANA
     What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
LUCIANA
     It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
LUCIANA
     Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
LUCIANA
     Why call you me love? call my sister so.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Thy sister's sister.
LUCIANA
     That's my sister.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     No;
     It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
     Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
     My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
     My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.
LUCIANA
     All this my sister is, or else should be.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
     Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
     Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
     Give me thy hand.
LUCIANA
     O, soft, air! hold you still:
     I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
     Exit
     Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
     am I myself?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.
ANTIPHOLUS
     What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
     that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What claim lays she to thee?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
     horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
     being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
     being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What is she?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
     not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
     but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
     wondrous fat marriage.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
     and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
     lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
     warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
     Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
     she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What complexion is she of?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
     clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
     shoes in the grime of it.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     That's a fault that water will mend.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What's her name?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
     an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
     hip to hip.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Then she bears some breadth?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
     she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
     countries in her.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     In what part of her body stands Ireland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Where Scotland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Where France?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
     against her heir.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Where England?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
     whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
     by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Where Spain?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Where America, the Indies?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
     rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
     aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
     armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
     drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
     Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
     privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
     shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
     left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
     And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
     faith and my heart of steel,
     She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
     me turn i' the wheel.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
     An if the wind blow any way from shore,
     I will not harbour in this town to-night:
     If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
     Where I will walk till thou return to me.
     If every one knows us and we know none,
     'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     As from a bear a man would run for life,
     So fly I from her that would be my wife.
     Exit
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     There's none but witches do inhabit here;
     And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
     She that doth call me husband, even my soul
     Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
     Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
     Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
     Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
     But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
     I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
     Enter ANGELO with the chain
ANGELO
     Master Antipholus,--
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO
     I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
     I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
     The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO
     What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO
     Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
     Go home with it and please your wife withal;
     And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
     And then receive my money for the chain.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
     For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
ANGELO
     You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
     Exit
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
     But this I think, there's no man is so vain
     That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
     I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
     When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
     I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
     If any ship put out, then straight away.
     Exit
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. A public place. ****
     Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer
Second Merchant
     You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
     And since I have not much importuned you;
     Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
     To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
     Therefore make present satisfaction,
     Or I'll attach you by this officer.
ANGELO
     Even just the sum that I do owe to you
     Is growing to me by Antipholus,
     And in the instant that I met with you
     He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
     I shall receive the money for the same.
     Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
     I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the
     courtezan's
Officer
     That labour may you save: see where he comes.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
     And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
     Among my wife and her confederates,
     For locking me out of my doors by day.
     But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
     Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
     Exit
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
     I promised your presence and the chain;
     But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
     Belike you thought our love would last too long,
     If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
ANGELO
     Saving your merry humour, here's the note
     How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
     The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
     Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
     Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
     I pray you, see him presently discharged,
     For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I am not furnish'd with the present money;
     Besides, I have some business in the town.
     Good signior, take the stranger to my house
     And with you take the chain and bid my wife
     Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
     Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
ANGELO
     Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO
     Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
     Or else you may return without your money.
ANGELO
     Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
     Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
     And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
     Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
     I should have chid you for not bringing it,
     But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
Second Merchant
     The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
ANGELO
     You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
ANGELO
     Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
     Either send the chain or send me by some token.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
     where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
Second Merchant
     My business cannot brook this dalliance.
     Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
     If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I answer you! what should I answer you?
ANGELO
     The money that you owe me for the chain.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO
     You know I gave it you half an hour since.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO
     You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
     Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Second Merchant
     Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
Officer
     I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
ANGELO
     This touches me in reputation.
     Either consent to pay this sum for me
     Or I attach you by this officer.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Consent to pay thee that I never had!
     Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
ANGELO
     Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
     I would not spare my brother in this case,
     If he should scorn me so apparently.
Officer
     I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
     But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
     As all the metal in your shop will answer.
ANGELO
     Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
     To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.
     Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
     That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
     And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
     I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
     The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
     The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
     Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
     But for their owner, master, and yourself.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
     What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
     And told thee to what purpose and what end.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
     You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I will debate this matter at more leisure
     And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
     To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
     Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
     That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
     There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
     Tell her I am arrested in the street
     And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
     On, officer, to prison till it come.
     Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     To Adriana! that is where we dined,
     Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
     She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
     Thither I must, although against my will,
     For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. ****
     Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA
     Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
     Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
     That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
     Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
     What observation madest thou in this case
     Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
LUCIANA
     First he denied you had in him no right.
ADRIANA
     He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
LUCIANA
     Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
ADRIANA
     And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
LUCIANA
     Then pleaded I for you.
ADRIANA
     And what said he?
LUCIANA
     That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
ADRIANA
     With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
LUCIANA
     With words that in an honest suit might move.
     First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
ADRIANA
     Didst speak him fair?
LUCIANA
     Have patience, I beseech.
ADRIANA
     I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
     My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
     He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
     Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
     Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
     Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
LUCIANA
     Who would be jealous then of such a one?
     No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
ADRIANA
     Ah, but I think him better than I say,
     And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
     Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
     My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
     Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.
LUCIANA
     How hast thou lost thy breath?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     By running fast.
ADRIANA
     Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
     A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
     One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
     A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
     A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
     A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
     countermands
     The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
     A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
     One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.
ADRIANA
     Why, man, what is the matter?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.
ADRIANA
     What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
     But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
     Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
ADRIANA
     Go fetch it, sister.
     Exit Luciana
     This I wonder at,
     That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
     Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
     A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?
ADRIANA
     What, the chain?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
     It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
     strikes one.
ADRIANA
     The hours come back! that did I never hear.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
     very fear.
ADRIANA
     As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
     worth, to season.
     Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
     That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
     If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
     Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
     Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
ADRIANA
     Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
     And bring thy master home immediately.
     Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
     Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

     There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
     As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
     And every one doth call me by my name.
     Some tender money to me; some invite me;
     Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
     Some offer me commodities to buy:
     Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
     And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
     And therewithal took measure of my body.
     Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
     And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
     Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
     you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
     that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
     skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
     behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
     forsake your liberty.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I understand thee not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
     bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
     that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
     and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
     men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
     his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
     morris-pike.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     What, thou meanest an officer?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
     any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
     thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
     give you good rest!'
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
     bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
     you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
     Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
     deliver you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     The fellow is distract, and so am I;
     And here we wander in illusions:
     Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
     Enter a Courtezan
Courtezan
     Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
     I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
     Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Master, is this Mistress Satan?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     It is the devil.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
     she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
     comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
     much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
     written, they appear to men like angels of light:
     light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
     ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
Courtezan
     Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
     Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
     long spoon.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Why, Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
     the devil.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
     Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
     I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
Courtezan
     Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
     Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
     And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
     A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
     A nut, a cherry-stone;
     But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
     Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
     The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
Courtezan
     I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
     I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
     Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
Courtezan
     Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
     Else would he never so demean himself.
     A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
     And for the same he promised me a chain:
     Both one and other he denies me now.
     The reason that I gather he is mad,
     Besides this present instance of his rage,
     Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
     Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
     Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
     On purpose shut the doors against his way.
     My way is now to hie home to his house,
     And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
     He rush'd into my house and took perforce
     My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
     For forty ducats is too much to lose.
     Exit
**** SCENE IV. A street. ****
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
     I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
     To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
     My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
     And will not lightly trust the messenger
     That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
     I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
     Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end
     Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
     How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     But where's the money?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
     Beating him
Officer
     Good sir, be patient.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.
Officer
     Good, now, hold thy tongue.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
     your blows.
ANTIPHOLUS
     Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
     ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
     ears. I have served him from the hour of my
     nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
     hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
     heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
     with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
     raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
     it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
     I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
     beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
     lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
     Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
     rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
     rope's-end.'
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Wilt thou still talk?
     Beating him
Courtezan
     How say you now? is not your husband mad?
ADRIANA
     His incivility confirms no less.
     Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
     Establish him in his true sense again,
     And I will please you what you will demand.
LUCIANA
     Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
Courtezan
     Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
PINCH
     Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
     Striking him
PINCH
     I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
     To yield possession to my holy prayers
     And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
     I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ADRIANA
     O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     You minion, you, are these your customers?
     Did this companion with the saffron face
     Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
     Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
     And I denied to enter in my house?
ADRIANA
     O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
     Where would you had remain'd until this time,
     Free from these slanders and this open shame!
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     And did not she herself revile me there?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     And did not I in rage depart from thence?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
     That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
ADRIANA
     Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
PINCH
     It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
     And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ADRIANA
     Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
     By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
     But surely master, not a rag of money.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
ADRIANA
     He came to me and I deliver'd it.
LUCIANA
     And I am witness with her that she did.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     God and the rope-maker bear me witness
     That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
PINCH
     Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
     I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
     They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
     And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
ADRIANA
     I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     And, gentle master, I received no gold;
     But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
ADRIANA
     Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
     And art confederate with a damned pack
     To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
     But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
     That would behold in me this shameful sport.
     Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives
ADRIANA
     O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
PINCH
     More company! The fiend is strong within him.
LUCIANA
     Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
     I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
     To make a rescue?
Officer
     Masters, let him go
     He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
PINCH
     Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
     They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus
ADRIANA
     What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
     Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
     Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
Officer
     He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
     The debt he owes will be required of me.
ADRIANA
     I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
     Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
     And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
     Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
     Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     O most unhappy strumpet!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
     cry 'The devil!'
LUCIANA
     God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
ADRIANA
     Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
     Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan
     Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
Officer
     One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?
ADRIANA
     I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
Officer
     Two hundred ducats.
ADRIANA
     Say, how grows it due?
Officer
     Due for a chain your husband had of him.
ADRIANA
     He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
Courtezan
     When as your husband all in rage to-day
     Came to my house and took away my ring--
     The ring I saw upon his finger now--
     Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
ADRIANA
     It may be so, but I did never see it.
     Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
     I long to know the truth hereof at large.
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of
     Syracuse
LUCIANA
     God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
ADRIANA
     And come with naked swords.
     Let's call more help to have them bound again.
Officer
     Away! they'll kill us.
     Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I see these witches are afraid of swords.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     She that would be your wife now ran from you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
     I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
     no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
     methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
     the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
     me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
     turn witch.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I will not stay to-night for all the town;
     Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
     Exeunt
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. A street before a Priory. ****
     Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO
ANGELO
     I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
     But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
     Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
Second Merchant
     How is the man esteemed here in the city?
ANGELO
     Of very reverend reputation, sir,
     Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
     Second to none that lives here in the city:
     His word might bear my wealth at any time.
Second Merchant
     Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
ANGELO
     'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
     Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
     Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
     Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
     That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
     And, not without some scandal to yourself,
     With circumstance and oaths so to deny
     This chain which now you wear so openly:
     Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
     You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
     Who, but for staying on our controversy,
     Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
     This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I think I had; I never did deny it.
Second Merchant
     Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
Second Merchant
     These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
     Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
     To walk where any honest man resort.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
     I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
     Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.
Second Merchant
     I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
     They draw
     Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others
ADRIANA
     Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
     Some get within him, take his sword away:
     Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
     This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!
     Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory
     Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA
AEMELIA
     Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
ADRIANA
     To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
     Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
     And bear him home for his recovery.
ANGELO
     I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
Second Merchant
     I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
AEMELIA
     How long hath this possession held the man?
ADRIANA
     This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
     And much different from the man he was;
     But till this afternoon his passion
     Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
AEMELIA
     Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
     Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
     Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
     A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
     Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
     Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
ADRIANA
     To none of these, except it be the last;
     Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
AEMELIA
     You should for that have reprehended him.
ADRIANA
     Why, so I did.
AEMELIA
     Ay, but not rough enough.
ADRIANA
     As roughly as my modesty would let me.
AEMELIA
     Haply, in private.
ADRIANA
     And in assemblies too.
AEMELIA
     Ay, but not enough.
ADRIANA
     It was the copy of our conference:
     In bed he slept not for my urging it;
     At board he fed not for my urging it;
     Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
     In company I often glanced it;
     Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
AEMELIA
     And thereof came it that the man was mad.
     The venom clamours of a jealous woman
     Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
     It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
     And therefore comes it that his head is light.
     Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
     Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
     Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
     And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
     Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
     Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
     But moody and dull melancholy,
     Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
     And at her heels a huge infectious troop
     Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
     In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
     To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
     The consequence is then thy jealous fits
     Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
LUCIANA
     She never reprehended him but mildly,
     When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
     Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
ADRIANA
     She did betray me to my own reproof.
     Good people enter and lay hold on him.
AEMELIA
     No, not a creature enters in my house.
ADRIANA
     Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
AEMELIA
     Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
     And it shall privilege him from your hands
     Till I have brought him to his wits again,
     Or lose my labour in assaying it.
ADRIANA
     I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
     Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
     And will have no attorney but myself;
     And therefore let me have him home with me.
AEMELIA
     Be patient; for I will not let him stir
     Till I have used the approved means I have,
     With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
     To make of him a formal man again:
     It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
     A charitable duty of my order.
     Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
ADRIANA
     I will not hence and leave my husband here:
     And ill it doth beseem your holiness
     To separate the husband and the wife.
AEMELIA
     Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
     Exit
LUCIANA
     Complain unto the duke of this indignity.
ADRIANA
     Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
     And never rise until my tears and prayers
     Have won his grace to come in person hither
     And take perforce my husband from the abbess.
Second Merchant
     By this, I think, the dial points at five:
     Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
     Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
     The place of death and sorry execution,
     Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
ANGELO
     Upon what cause?
Second Merchant
     To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
     Who put unluckily into this bay
     Against the laws and statutes of this town,
     Beheaded publicly for his offence.
ANGELO
     See where they come: we will behold his death.
LUCIANA
     Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
     Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman
     and other Officers
DUKE SOLINUS
     Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
     If any friend will pay the sum for him,
     He shall not die; so much we tender him.
ADRIANA
     Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!
DUKE SOLINUS
     She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
     It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
ADRIANA
     May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
     Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
     At your important letters,--this ill day
     A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
     That desperately he hurried through the street,
     With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
     Doing displeasure to the citizens
     By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
     Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
     Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
     Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
     That here and there his fury had committed.
     Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
     He broke from those that had the guard of him;
     And with his mad attendant and himself,
     Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
     Met us again and madly bent on us,
     Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
     We came again to bind them. Then they fled
     Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
     And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
     And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
     Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
     Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
     Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
     And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
     When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
     To do him all the grace and good I could.
     Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
     And bid the lady abbess come to me.
     I will determine this before I stir.
     Enter a Servant
Servant
     O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
     My master and his man are both broke loose,
     Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
     Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
     And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
     Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
     My master preaches patience to him and the while
     His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
     And sure, unless you send some present help,
     Between them they will kill the conjurer.
ADRIANA
     Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
     And that is false thou dost report to us.
Servant
     Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
     I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
     He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
     To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
     Cry within
     Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
DUKE SOLINUS
     Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!
ADRIANA
     Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
     That he is borne about invisible:
     Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
     And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
     Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
     Even for the service that long since I did thee,
     When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
     Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
     That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
AEGEON
     Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
     I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
     She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
     That hath abused and dishonour'd me
     Even in the strength and height of injury!
     Beyond imagination is the wrong
     That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
     While she with harlots feasted in my house.
DUKE SOLINUS
     A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
ADRIANA
     No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
     To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
     As this is false he burdens me withal!
LUCIANA
     Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
     But she tells to your highness simple truth!
ANGELO
     O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
     In this the madman justly chargeth them.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     My liege, I am advised what I say,
     Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
     Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
     Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
     This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
     That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
     Could witness it, for he was with me then;
     Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
     Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
     Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
     Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
     I went to seek him: in the street I met him
     And in his company that gentleman.
     There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
     That I this day of him received the chain,
     Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
     He did arrest me with an officer.
     I did obey, and sent my peasant home
     For certain ducats: he with none return'd
     Then fairly I bespoke the officer
     To go in person with me to my house.
     By the way we met
     My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
     Of vile confederates. Along with them
     They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
     A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
     A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
     A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
     A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
     Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
     And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
     And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
     Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
     They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
     And in a dark and dankish vault at home
     There left me and my man, both bound together;
     Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
     I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
     Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
     To give me ample satisfaction
     For these deep shames and great indignities.
ANGELO
     My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
     That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
DUKE SOLINUS
     But had he such a chain of thee or no?
ANGELO
     He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
     These people saw the chain about his neck.
Second Merchant
     Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
     Heard you confess you had the chain of him
     After you first forswore it on the mart:
     And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
     And then you fled into this abbey here,
     From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I never came within these abbey-walls,
     Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
     I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
     And this is false you burden me withal.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
     I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
     If here you housed him, here he would have been;
     If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
     You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
     Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
Courtezan
     He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
Courtezan
     As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
     I think you are all mated or stark mad.
     Exit one to Abbess
AEGEON
     Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
     Haply I see a friend will save my life
     And pay the sum that may deliver me.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
AEGEON
     Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
     And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
     But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
     Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
AEGEON
     I am sure you both of you remember me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
     For lately we were bound, as you are now
     You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
AEGEON
     Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
ANTIPHOLUS
     I never saw you in my life till now.
AEGEON
     O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
     And careful hours with time's deformed hand
     Have written strange defeatures in my face:
     But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Neither.
AEGEON
     Dromio, nor thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     No, trust me, sir, nor I.
AEGEON
     I am sure thou dost.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
     man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
AEGEON
     Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
     Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
     In seven short years, that here my only son
     Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
     Though now this grained face of mine be hid
     In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
     And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
     Yet hath my night of life some memory,
     My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
     My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
     All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
     Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I never saw my father in my life.
AEGEON
     But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
     Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
     Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     The duke and all that know me in the city
     Can witness with me that it is not so
     I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
DUKE SOLINUS
     I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
     Have I been patron to Antipholus,
     During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
     I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
     Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
AEMELIA
     Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
     All gather to see them
ADRIANA
     I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
DUKE SOLINUS
     One of these men is Genius to the other;
     And so of these. Which is the natural man,
     And which the spirit? who deciphers them?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     O, my old master! who hath bound him here?
AEMELIA
     Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
     And gain a husband by his liberty.
     Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
     That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
     That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
     O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
     And speak unto the same AEmilia!
AEGEON
     If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
     If thou art she, tell me where is that son
     That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
AEMELIA
     By men of Epidamnum he and I
     And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
     But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
     By force took Dromio and my son from them
     And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
     What then became of them I cannot tell
     I to this fortune that you see me in.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Why, here begins his morning story right;
     These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
     And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
     Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
     These are the parents to these children,
     Which accidentally are met together.
     Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
DUKE SOLINUS
     Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     And I with him.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
     Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
ADRIANA
     Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I, gentle mistress.
ADRIANA
     And are not you my husband?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     No; I say nay to that.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     And so do I; yet did she call me so:
     And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
     Did call me brother.
     To Luciana
     What I told you then,
     I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
     If this be not a dream I see and hear.
ANGELO
     That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO
     I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ADRIANA
     I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
     By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     No, none by me.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     This purse of ducats I received from you,
     And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
     I see we still did meet each other's man,
     And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
     And thereupon these errors are arose.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     These ducats pawn I for my father here.
DUKE SOLINUS
     It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
Courtezan
     Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
AEMELIA
     Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
     To go with us into the abbey here
     And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
     And all that are assembled in this place,
     That by this sympathized one day's error
     Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
     And we shall make full satisfaction.
     Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
     Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
     My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
     The duke, my husband and my children both,
     And you the calendars of their nativity,
     Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
     After so long grief, such festivity!
DUKE SOLINUS
     With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
     Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio
     of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
     Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
     ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
     He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
     Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
     Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
     Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     There is a fat friend at your master's house,
     That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
     She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
     I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
     Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     Not I, sir; you are my elder.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     That's a question: how shall we try it?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
     We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
     Nay, then, thus:
     We came into the world like brother and brother;
     And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
     Exeunt
Loves Labours Lost
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park. ****
     Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
FERDINAND
     Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
     Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
     And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
     When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
     The endeavor of this present breath may buy
     That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
     And make us heirs of all eternity.
     Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
     That war against your own affections
     And the huge army of the world's desires,--
     Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
     Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
     Our court shall be a little Academe,
     Still and contemplative in living art.
     You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
     Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
     My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
     That are recorded in this schedule here:
     Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
     That his own hand may strike his honour down
     That violates the smallest branch herein:
     If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
     Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
LONGAVILLE
     I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
     The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
     Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
     Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
DUMAIN
     My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
     The grosser manner of these world's delights
     He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
     To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
     With all these living in philosophy.
BIRON
     I can but say their protestation over;
     So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
     That is, to live and study here three years.
     But there are other strict observances;
     As, not to see a woman in that term,
     Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
     And one day in a week to touch no food
     And but one meal on every day beside,
     The which I hope is not enrolled there;
     And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
     And not be seen to wink of all the day--
     When I was wont to think no harm all night
     And make a dark night too of half the day--
     Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
     O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
     Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
FERDINAND
     Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
BIRON
     Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
     I only swore to study with your grace
     And stay here in your court for three years' space.
LONGAVILLE
     You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
BIRON
     By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
     What is the end of study? let me know.
FERDINAND
     Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
BIRON
     Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
FERDINAND
     Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
BIRON
     Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
     To know the thing I am forbid to know:
     As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
     When I to feast expressly am forbid;
     Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
     When mistresses from common sense are hid;
     Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
     Study to break it and not break my troth.
     If study's gain be thus and this be so,
     Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
     Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
FERDINAND
     These be the stops that hinder study quite
     And train our intellects to vain delight.
BIRON
     Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
     Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
     As, painfully to pore upon a book
     To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
     Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
     Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
     So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
     Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
     Study me how to please the eye indeed
     By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
     Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
     And give him light that it was blinded by.
     Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
     That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
     Small have continual plodders ever won
     Save base authority from others' books
     These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
     That give a name to every fixed star
     Have no more profit of their shining nights
     Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
     Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
     And every godfather can give a name.
FERDINAND
     How well he's read, to reason against reading!
DUMAIN
     Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
LONGAVILLE
     He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
BIRON
     The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
DUMAIN
     How follows that?
BIRON
     Fit in his place and time.
DUMAIN
     In reason nothing.
BIRON
     Something then in rhyme.
FERDINAND
     Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
     That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
BIRON
     Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
     Before the birds have any cause to sing?
     Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
     At Christmas I no more desire a rose
     Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
     But like of each thing that in season grows.
     So you, to study now it is too late,
     Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
FERDINAND
     Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
BIRON
     No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
     And though I have for barbarism spoke more
     Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
     Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
     And bide the penance of each three years' day.
     Give me the paper; let me read the same;
     And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
FERDINAND
     How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
BIRON
     [Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a
     mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
LONGAVILLE
     Four days ago.
BIRON
     Let's see the penalty.
     Reads
     'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
LONGAVILLE
     Marry, that did I.
BIRON
     Sweet lord, and why?
LONGAVILLE
     To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
BIRON
     A dangerous law against gentility!
     Reads
     'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
     within the term of three years, he shall endure such
     public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
     This article, my liege, yourself must break;
     For well you know here comes in embassy
     The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
     A maid of grace and complete majesty--
     About surrender up of Aquitaine
     To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
     Therefore this article is made in vain,
     Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
FERDINAND
     What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
BIRON
     So study evermore is overshot:
     While it doth study to have what it would
     It doth forget to do the thing it should,
     And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
     'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
FERDINAND
     We must of force dispense with this decree;
     She must lie here on mere necessity.
BIRON
     Necessity will make us all forsworn
     Three thousand times within this three years' space;
     For every man with his affects is born,
     Not by might master'd but by special grace:
     If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
     I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
     So to the laws at large I write my name:
     Subscribes
     And he that breaks them in the least degree
     Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
     Suggestions are to other as to me;
     But I believe, although I seem so loath,
     I am the last that will last keep his oath.
     But is there no quick recreation granted?
FERDINAND
     Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
     With a refined traveller of Spain;
     A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
     That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
     One whom the music of his own vain tongue
     Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
     A man of complements, whom right and wrong
     Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
     This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
     For interim to our studies shall relate
     In high-born words the worth of many a knight
     From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
     How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
     But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
     And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
BIRON
     Armado is a most illustrious wight,
     A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
LONGAVILLE
     Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
     And so to study, three years is but short.
     Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD
DULL
     Which is the duke's own person?
BIRON
     This, fellow: what wouldst?
DULL
     I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
     grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
     in flesh and blood.
BIRON
     This is he.
DULL
     Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
     abroad: this letter will tell you more.
COSTARD
     Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
FERDINAND
     A letter from the magnificent Armado.
BIRON
     How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
LONGAVILLE
     A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
BIRON
     To hear? or forbear laughing?
LONGAVILLE
     To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
     forbear both.
BIRON
     Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
     climb in the merriness.
COSTARD
     The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
     The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
BIRON
     In what manner?
COSTARD
     In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
     I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
     her upon the form, and taken following her into the
     park; which, put together, is in manner and form
     following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
     manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
     in some form.
BIRON
     For the following, sir?
COSTARD
     As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
     the right!
FERDINAND
     Will you hear this letter with attention?
BIRON
     As we would hear an oracle.
COSTARD
     Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
     sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
     and body's fostering patron.'
COSTARD
     Not a word of Costard yet.
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'So it is,'--
COSTARD
     It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
     telling true, but so.
FERDINAND
     Peace!
COSTARD
     Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
FERDINAND
     No words!
COSTARD
     Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
     melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
     to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
     air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
     walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
     beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
     to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
     for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
     I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
     for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
     that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
     from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
     here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
     but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
     and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
     knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
     swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
COSTARD
     Me?
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
COSTARD
     Me?
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--
COSTARD
     Still me?
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
COSTARD
     O, me!
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
     established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
     which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
     wherewith,--
COSTARD
     With a wench.
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
     female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
     woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
     have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
     punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
     Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
     estimation.'
DULL
     'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
FERDINAND
     [Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
     called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
     swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
     and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
     her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
     and heart-burning heat of duty.
     DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
BIRON
     This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
     that ever I heard.
FERDINAND
     Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
     you to this?
COSTARD
     Sir, I confess the wench.
FERDINAND
     Did you hear the proclamation?
COSTARD
     I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
     the marking of it.
FERDINAND
     It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
     with a wench.
COSTARD
     I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
FERDINAND
     Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
COSTARD
     This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
FERDINAND
     It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
COSTARD
     If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
FERDINAND
     This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
COSTARD
     This maid will serve my turn, sir.
FERDINAND
     Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
     a week with bran and water.
COSTARD
     I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
FERDINAND
     And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
     My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
     And go we, lords, to put in practise that
     Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
     Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN
BIRON
     I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
     These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
     Sirrah, come on.
COSTARD
     I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
     taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
     girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
     prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
     till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
     Exeunt
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** SCENE II. The same. ****
     Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
     grows melancholy?
MOTH
     A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH
     No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
     tender juvenal?
MOTH
     By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Why tough senior? why tough senior?
MOTH
     Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
     appertaining to thy young days, which we may
     nominate tender.
MOTH
     And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
     old time, which we may name tough.
     DON ADRIANO DE
ARMADO
     Pretty and apt.
MOTH
     How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
     I apt, and my saying pretty?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH
     Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH
     Speak you this in my praise, master?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     In thy condign praise.
MOTH
     I will praise an eel with the same praise.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     What, that an eel is ingenious?
MOTH
     That an eel is quick.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
MOTH
     I am answered, sir.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I love not to be crossed.
MOTH
     [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I have promised to study three years with the duke.
MOTH
     You may do it in an hour, sir.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Impossible.
MOTH
     How many is one thrice told?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
MOTH
     You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
     complete man.
MOTH
     Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
     deuce-ace amounts to.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     It doth amount to one more than two.
MOTH
     Which the base vulgar do call three.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     True.
MOTH
     Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
     is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
     easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
     study three years in two words, the dancing horse
     will tell you.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     A most fine figure!
MOTH
     To prove you a cipher.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
     base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
     base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
     of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
     thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
     ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
     courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
     outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
     have been in love?
MOTH
     Hercules, master.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
     more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
     repute and carriage.
MOTH
     Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
     carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
     like a porter: and he was in love.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
     excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
     carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
     love, my dear Moth?
MOTH
     A woman, master.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Of what complexion?
MOTH
     Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Tell me precisely of what complexion.
MOTH
     Of the sea-water green, sir.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Is that one of the four complexions?
MOTH
     As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
     love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
     for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
MOTH
     It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     My love is most immaculate white and red.
MOTH
     Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
     such colours.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Define, define, well-educated infant.
MOTH
     My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
     pathetical!
MOTH
     If she be made of white and red,
     Her faults will ne'er be known,
     For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
     And fears by pale white shown:
     Then if she fear, or be to blame,
     By this you shall not know,
     For still her cheeks possess the same
     Which native she doth owe.
     A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
     white and red.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
MOTH
     The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
     three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
     found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
     the writing nor the tune.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
     example my digression by some mighty precedent.
     Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
     park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
MOTH
     [Aside] To be whipped; and yet a better love than
     my master.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
MOTH
     And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I say, sing.
MOTH
     Forbear till this company be past.
     Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA
DULL
     Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
     safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
     nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
     For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
     is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
JAQUENETTA
     Man?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I will visit thee at the lodge.
JAQUENETTA
     That's hereby.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I know where it is situate.
JAQUENETTA
     Lord, how wise you are!
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I will tell thee wonders.
JAQUENETTA
     With that face?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I love thee.
JAQUENETTA
     So I heard you say.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     And so, farewell.
JAQUENETTA
     Fair weather after you!
DULL
     Come, Jaquenetta, away!
     Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
     be pardoned.
COSTARD
     Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
     full stomach.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Thou shalt be heavily punished.
COSTARD
     I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
     are but lightly rewarded.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Take away this villain; shut him up.
MOTH
     Come, you transgressing slave; away!
COSTARD
     Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
MOTH
     No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
COSTARD
     Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
     that I have seen, some shall see.
MOTH
     What shall some see?
COSTARD
     Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
     It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
     words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
     God I have as little patience as another man; and
     therefore I can be quiet.
     Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
     her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
     is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
     is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
     how can that be true love which is falsely
     attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
     there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
     tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
     Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
     Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
     and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
     The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
     the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
     not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
     glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
     be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
     he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
     for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
     write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.
     Exit
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. The same. ****
     Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET,
     Lords, and other Attendants
BOYET
     Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
     Consider who the king your father sends,
     To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
     Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
     To parley with the sole inheritor
     Of all perfections that a man may owe,
     Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
     Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
     Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
     As Nature was in making graces dear
     When she did starve the general world beside
     And prodigally gave them all to you.
PRINCESS
     Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
     Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
     Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
     Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
     I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
     Than you much willing to be counted wise
     In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
     But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
     You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
     Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
     Till painful study shall outwear three years,
     No woman may approach his silent court:
     Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
     Before we enter his forbidden gates,
     To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
     Bold of your worthiness, we single you
     As our best-moving fair solicitor.
     Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
     On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
     Importunes personal conference with his grace:
     Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
     Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
BOYET
     Proud of employment, willingly I go.
PRINCESS
     All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
     Exit BOYET
     Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
     That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
First Lord
     Lord Longaville is one.
PRINCESS
     Know you the man?
MARIA
     I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
     Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
     Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
     In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
     A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
     Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
     Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
     The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
     If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
     Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
     Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
     It should none spare that come within his power.
PRINCESS
     Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
MARIA
     They say so most that most his humours know.
PRINCESS
     Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
     Who are the rest?
KATHARINE
     The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
     Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
     Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
     For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
     And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
     I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
     And much too little of that good I saw
     Is my report to his great worthiness.
ROSALINE
     Another of these students at that time
     Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
     Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
     Within the limit of becoming mirth,
     I never spent an hour's talk withal:
     His eye begets occasion for his wit;
     For every object that the one doth catch
     The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
     Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
     Delivers in such apt and gracious words
     That aged ears play truant at his tales
     And younger hearings are quite ravished;
     So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
PRINCESS
     God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
     That every one her own hath garnished
     With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
First Lord
     Here comes Boyet.
     Re-enter BOYET
PRINCESS
     Now, what admittance, lord?
BOYET
     Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
     And he and his competitors in oath
     Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
     Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
     He rather means to lodge you in the field,
     Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
     Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
     To let you enter his unpeopled house.
     Here comes Navarre.
     Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants
FERDINAND
     Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
PRINCESS
     'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
     not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
     yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
FERDINAND
     You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
PRINCESS
     I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
FERDINAND
     Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
PRINCESS
     Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
FERDINAND
     Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
PRINCESS
     Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
FERDINAND
     Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
PRINCESS
     Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
     Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
     I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
     Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
     And sin to break it.
     But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
     To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
     Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
     And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
FERDINAND
     Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
PRINCESS
     You will the sooner, that I were away;
     For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
BIRON
     Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
ROSALINE
     Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
BIRON
     I know you did.
ROSALINE
     How needless was it then to ask the question!
BIRON
     You must not be so quick.
ROSALINE
     'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
BIRON
     Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
ROSALINE
     Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
BIRON
     What time o' day?
ROSALINE
     The hour that fools should ask.
BIRON
     Now fair befall your mask!
ROSALINE
     Fair fall the face it covers!
BIRON
     And send you many lovers!
ROSALINE
     Amen, so you be none.
BIRON
     Nay, then will I be gone.
FERDINAND
     Madam, your father here doth intimate
     The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
     Being but the one half of an entire sum
     Disbursed by my father in his wars.
     But say that he or we, as neither have,
     Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
     A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
     One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
     Although not valued to the money's worth.
     If then the king your father will restore
     But that one half which is unsatisfied,
     We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
     And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
     But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
     For here he doth demand to have repaid
     A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
     On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
     To have his title live in Aquitaine;
     Which we much rather had depart withal
     And have the money by our father lent
     Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
     Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
     From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
     A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
     And go well satisfied to France again.
PRINCESS
     You do the king my father too much wrong
     And wrong the reputation of your name,
     In so unseeming to confess receipt
     Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
FERDINAND
     I do protest I never heard of it;
     And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
     Or yield up Aquitaine.
PRINCESS
     We arrest your word.
     Boyet, you can produce acquittances
     For such a sum from special officers
     Of Charles his father.
FERDINAND
     Satisfy me so.
BOYET
     So please your grace, the packet is not come
     Where that and other specialties are bound:
     To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
FERDINAND
     It shall suffice me: at which interview
     All liberal reason I will yield unto.
     Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
     As honour without breach of honour may
     Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
     You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
     But here without you shall be so received
     As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
     Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
     Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
     To-morrow shall we visit you again.
PRINCESS
     Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
FERDINAND
     Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
     Exit
BIRON
     Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
ROSALINE
     Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
BIRON
     I would you heard it groan.
ROSALINE
     Is the fool sick?
BIRON
     Sick at the heart.
ROSALINE
     Alack, let it blood.
BIRON
     Would that do it good?
ROSALINE
     My physic says 'ay.'
BIRON
     Will you prick't with your eye?
ROSALINE
     No point, with my knife.
BIRON
     Now, God save thy life!
ROSALINE
     And yours from long living!
BIRON
     I cannot stay thanksgiving.
     Retiring
DUMAIN
     Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
BOYET
     The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
DUMAIN
     A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
     Exit
LONGAVILLE
     I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
BOYET
     A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
LONGAVILLE
     Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
BOYET
     She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
LONGAVILLE
     Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
BOYET
     Her mother's, I have heard.
LONGAVILLE
     God's blessing on your beard!
BOYET
     Good sir, be not offended.
     She is an heir of Falconbridge.
LONGAVILLE
     Nay, my choler is ended.
     She is a most sweet lady.
BOYET
     Not unlike, sir, that may be.
     Exit LONGAVILLE
BIRON
     What's her name in the cap?
BOYET
     Rosaline, by good hap.
BIRON
     Is she wedded or no?
BOYET
     To her will, sir, or so.
BIRON
     You are welcome, sir: adieu.
BOYET
     Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
     Exit BIRON
MARIA
     That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
     Not a word with him but a jest.
BOYET
     And every jest but a word.
PRINCESS
     It was well done of you to take him at his word.
BOYET
     I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
MARIA
     Two hot sheeps, marry.
BOYET
     And wherefore not ships?
     No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
MARIA
     You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
BOYET
     So you grant pasture for me.
     Offering to kiss her
MARIA
     Not so, gentle beast:
     My lips are no common, though several they be.
BOYET
     Belonging to whom?
MARIA
     To my fortunes and me.
PRINCESS
     Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
     This civil war of wits were much better used
     On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
BOYET
     If my observation, which very seldom lies,
     By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
     Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
PRINCESS
     With what?
BOYET
     With that which we lovers entitle affected.
PRINCESS
     Your reason?
BOYET
     Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
     To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
     His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
     Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
     His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
     Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
     All senses to that sense did make their repair,
     To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
     Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
     As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
     Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
     Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
     His face's own margent did quote such amazes
     That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
     I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
     An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
PRINCESS
     Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
BOYET
     But to speak that in words which his eye hath
     disclosed.
     I only have made a mouth of his eye,
     By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
ROSALINE
     Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
MARIA
     He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
ROSALINE
     Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
BOYET
     Do you hear, my mad wenches?
MARIA
     No.
BOYET
     What then, do you see?
ROSALINE
     Ay, our way to be gone.
BOYET
     You are too hard for me.
     Exeunt
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. The same. ****
     Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
MOTH
     Concolinel.
     Singing
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
     give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
     hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
MOTH
     Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     How meanest thou? brawling in French?
MOTH
     No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
     the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
     it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
     sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
     swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
     the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
     love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
     your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
     doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
     your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
     keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
     These are complements, these are humours; these
     betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
     these; and make them men of note--do you note
     me?--that most are affected to these.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     How hast thou purchased this experience?
MOTH
     By my penny of observation.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     But O,--but O,--
MOTH
     'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
MOTH
     No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
     love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Almost I had.
MOTH
     Negligent student! learn her by heart.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     By heart and in heart, boy.
MOTH
     And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     What wilt thou prove?
MOTH
     A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
     the instant: by heart you love her, because your
     heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
     because your heart is in love with her; and out of
     heart you love her, being out of heart that you
     cannot enjoy her.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I am all these three.
MOTH
     And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
     all.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
MOTH
     A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
     for an ass.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
MOTH
     Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
     for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     The way is but short: away!
MOTH
     As swift as lead, sir.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     The meaning, pretty ingenious?
     Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
MOTH
     Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I say lead is slow.
MOTH
     You are too swift, sir, to say so:
     Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
     He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
     I shoot thee at the swain.
MOTH
     Thump then and I flee.
     Exit
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
     By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
     Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
     My herald is return'd.
     Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD
MOTH
     A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
COSTARD
     No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
     mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
     l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
     thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
     me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
     Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
     the word l'envoy for a salve?
MOTH
     Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
     Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
     I will example it:
     The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
     Were still at odds, being but three.
     There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
MOTH
     I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
     Were still at odds, being but three.
MOTH
     Until the goose came out of door,
     And stay'd the odds by adding four.
     Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
     my l'envoy.
     The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
     Were still at odds, being but three.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Until the goose came out of door,
     Staying the odds by adding four.
MOTH
     A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
     desire more?
COSTARD
     The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
     Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
     To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
     Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
MOTH
     By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
     Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
COSTARD
     True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
     argument in;
     Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
     And he ended the market.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
MOTH
     I will tell you sensibly.
COSTARD
     Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
     I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
     Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     We will talk no more of this matter.
COSTARD
     Till there be more matter in the shin.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
COSTARD
     O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
     some goose, in this.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
     enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
     restrained, captivated, bound.
COSTARD
     True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
     in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
     bear this significant
     Giving a letter
     to the country maid Jaquenetta:
     there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
     honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
     Exit
MOTH
     Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
COSTARD
     My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
     Exit MOTH
     Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
     O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
     farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
     inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
     remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
     why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
     never buy and sell out of this word.
     Enter BIRON
BIRON
     O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
COSTARD
     Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
     buy for a remuneration?
BIRON
     What is a remuneration?
COSTARD
     Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
BIRON
     Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
COSTARD
     I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
BIRON
     Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
     As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
     Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
COSTARD
     When would you have it done, sir?
BIRON
     This afternoon.
COSTARD
     Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
BIRON
     Thou knowest not what it is.
COSTARD
     I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
BIRON
     Why, villain, thou must know first.
COSTARD
     I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
BIRON
     It must be done this afternoon.
     Hark, slave, it is but this:
     The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
     And in her train there is a gentle lady;
     When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
     And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
     And to her white hand see thou do commend
     This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
     Giving him a shilling
COSTARD
     Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
     a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
     will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
     Exit
BIRON
     And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
     A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
     A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
     A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
     Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
     This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
     This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
     Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
     The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
     Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
     Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
     Sole imperator and great general
     Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
     And I to be a corporal of his field,
     And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
     What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
     A woman, that is like a German clock,
     Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
     And never going aright, being a watch,
     But being watch'd that it may still go right!
     Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
     And, among three, to love the worst of all;
     A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
     With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
     Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
     Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
     And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
     To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
     That Cupid will impose for my neglect
     Of his almighty dreadful little might.
     Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
     Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
     Exit
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. The same. ****
     Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE,
     MARIA, and KATHARINE
PRINCESS
     Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
     Against the steep uprising of the hill?
BOYET
     I know not; but I think it was not he.
PRINCESS
     Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
     Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
     On Saturday we will return to France.
     Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
     That we must stand and play the murderer in?
Forester
     Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
     A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
PRINCESS
     I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
     And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
Forester
     Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
PRINCESS
     What, what? first praise me and again say no?
     O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
Forester
     Yes, madam, fair.
PRINCESS
     Nay, never paint me now:
     Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
     Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
     Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
Forester
     Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
PRINCESS
     See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
     O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
     A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
     But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
     And shooting well is then accounted ill.
     Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
     Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
     If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
     That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
     And out of question so it is sometimes,
     Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
     When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
     We bend to that the working of the heart;
     As I for praise alone now seek to spill
     The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
BOYET
     Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
     Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
     Lords o'er their lords?
PRINCESS
     Only for praise: and praise we may afford
     To any lady that subdues a lord.
BOYET
     Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
     Enter COSTARD
COSTARD
     God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
PRINCESS
     Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
COSTARD
     Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
PRINCESS
     The thickest and the tallest.
COSTARD
     The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
     An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
     One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
     Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
PRINCESS
     What's your will, sir? what's your will?
COSTARD
     I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
PRINCESS
     O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
     Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
     Break up this capon.
BOYET
     I am bound to serve.
     This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
     It is writ to Jaquenetta.
PRINCESS
     We will read it, I swear.
     Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
     Reads
BOYET
     'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
     true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
     thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
     than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
     commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
     magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
     eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
     Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
     Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
     vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
     came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
     overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
     come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
     whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
     beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
     conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
     The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
     beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
     side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
     both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
     thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
     Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
     thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
     will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
     for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
     expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
     my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
     part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
     DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
     Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
     'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
     Submissive fall his princely feet before,
     And he from forage will incline to play:
     But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
     Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
PRINCESS
     What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
     What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
BOYET
     I am much deceived but I remember the style.
PRINCESS
     Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
BOYET
     This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
     A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
     To the prince and his bookmates.
PRINCESS
     Thou fellow, a word:
     Who gave thee this letter?
COSTARD
     I told you; my lord.
PRINCESS
     To whom shouldst thou give it?
COSTARD
     From my lord to my lady.
PRINCESS
     From which lord to which lady?
COSTARD
     From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
     To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.
PRINCESS
     Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
     To ROSALINE
     Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
     Exeunt PRINCESS and train
BOYET
     Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
ROSALINE
     Shall I teach you to know?
BOYET
     Ay, my continent of beauty.
ROSALINE
     Why, she that bears the bow.
     Finely put off!
BOYET
     My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
     Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
     Finely put on!
ROSALINE
     Well, then, I am the shooter.
BOYET
     And who is your deer?
ROSALINE
     If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
     Finely put on, indeed!
MARIA
     You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
     at the brow.
BOYET
     But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
ROSALINE
     Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
     a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
     touching the hit it?
BOYET
     So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
     woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
     wench, as touching the hit it.
ROSALINE
     Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
     Thou canst not hit it, my good man.
BOYET
     An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
     An I cannot, another can.
     Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE
COSTARD
     By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!
MARIA
     A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
BOYET
     A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
     Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
MARIA
     Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
COSTARD
     Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
BOYET
     An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
COSTARD
     Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
MARIA
     Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
COSTARD
     She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
BOYET
     I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
     Exeunt BOYET and MARIA
COSTARD
     By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
     Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
     O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
     vulgar wit!
     When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
     were, so fit.
     Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
     To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
     To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
     will swear!
     And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
     Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
     Sola, sola!

     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** SCENE II. The same. ****
     Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL
SIR NATHANIEL
     Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
     of a good conscience.
HOLOFERNES
     The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
     as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
     the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
     and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
     the soil, the land, the earth.
SIR NATHANIEL
     Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
     varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
     assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
HOLOFERNES
     Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
DULL
     'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
HOLOFERNES
     Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
     insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
     explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
     rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
     inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
     uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
     unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
     insert again my haud credo for a deer.
DULL
     I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.
HOLOFERNES
     Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
     O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
SIR NATHANIEL
     Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
     in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
     hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
     replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
     the duller parts:
     And such barren plants are set before us, that we
     thankful should be,
     Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
     do fructify in us more than he.
     For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
     So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
     But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
     Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
DULL
     You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
     What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
     weeks old as yet?
HOLOFERNES
     Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
DULL
     What is Dictynna?
SIR NATHANIEL
     A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
HOLOFERNES
     The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
     And raught not to five weeks when he came to
     five-score.
     The allusion holds in the exchange.
DULL
     'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
HOLOFERNES
     God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
     in the exchange.
DULL
     And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
     the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
     that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
HOLOFERNES
     Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
     on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
     ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
SIR NATHANIEL
     Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
     please you to abrogate scurrility.
HOLOFERNES
     I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
     The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
     pleasing pricket;
     Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
     sore with shooting.
     The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
     from thicket;
     Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
     If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
     one sorel.
     Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
SIR NATHANIEL
     A rare talent!
DULL
     [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
     him with a talent.
HOLOFERNES
     This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
     foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
     shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
     revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
     memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
     delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
     gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
     thankful for it.
SIR NATHANIEL
     Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
     parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
     you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
     you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
HOLOFERNES
     Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
     want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
     I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
     loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
     Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA
     God give you good morrow, master Parson.
HOLOFERNES
     Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
     pierced, which is the one?
COSTARD
     Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
HOLOFERNES
     Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
     tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
     for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
JAQUENETTA
     Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
     letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
     from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
HOLOFERNES
     Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
     Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
     may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
     Venetia, Venetia,
     Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
     Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
     not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
     Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
     as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
SIR NATHANIEL
     Ay, sir, and very learned.
HOLOFERNES
     Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
SIR NATHANIEL
     [Reads]
     If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
     Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
     Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
     Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
     osiers bow'd.
     Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
     Where all those pleasures live that art would
     comprehend:
     If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
     Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
     All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
     Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
     Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
     Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
     Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
     That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
HOLOFERNES
     You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
     accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
     only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
     facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
     Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
     but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
     fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
     so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
     the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
     was this directed to you?
JAQUENETTA
     Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
     queen's lords.
HOLOFERNES
     I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
     snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
     Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
     the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
     to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
     desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
     Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
     he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
     queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
     progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
     sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
     king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
     compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.
JAQUENETTA
     Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
COSTARD
     Have with thee, my girl.
     Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
SIR NATHANIEL
     Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
     religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--
HOLOFERNES
     Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
     colours. But to return to the verses: did they
     please you, Sir Nathaniel?
SIR NATHANIEL
     Marvellous well for the pen.
HOLOFERNES
     I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
     of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
     you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
     privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
     child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
     will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
     neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
     beseech your society.
SIR NATHANIEL
     And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
     the happiness of life.
HOLOFERNES
     And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
     To DULL
     Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
     say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
     their game, and we will to our recreation.
     Exeunt
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** SCENE III. The same. ****
     Enter BIRON, with a paper
BIRON
     The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
     myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
     a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
     word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
     the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
     proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
     Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
     well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
     I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
     eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
     love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
     in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
     heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
     and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
     and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
     sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
     it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
     fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
     a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
     with a paper: God give him grace to groan!
     Stands aside
     Enter FERDINAND, with a paper
FERDINAND
     Ay me!
BIRON
     [Aside] Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
     thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
     left pap. In faith, secrets!
FERDINAND
     [Reads]
     So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
     To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
     As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
     The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
     Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
     Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
     As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
     Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
     No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
     So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
     Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
     And they thy glory through my grief will show:
     But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
     My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
     O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
     No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
     How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
     Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
     Steps aside
     What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
BIRON
     Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
     Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper
LONGAVILLE
     Ay me, I am forsworn!
BIRON
     Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
FERDINAND
     In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
BIRON
     One drunkard loves another of the name.
LONGAVILLE
     Am I the first that have been perjured so?
BIRON
     I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
     Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
     The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
LONGAVILLE
     I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
     O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
     These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
BIRON
     O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
     Disfigure not his slop.
LONGAVILLE
     This same shall go.
     Reads
     Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
     'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
     Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
     Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
     A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
     Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
     My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
     Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
     Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
     Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
     Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
     If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
     If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
     To lose an oath to win a paradise?
BIRON
     This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
     A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
     God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.
LONGAVILLE
     By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
     Steps aside
BIRON
     All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
     Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
     And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
     More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
     Enter DUMAIN, with a paper
     Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
DUMAIN
     O most divine Kate!
BIRON
     O most profane coxcomb!
DUMAIN
     By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
BIRON
     By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
DUMAIN
     Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
BIRON
     An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
DUMAIN
     As upright as the cedar.
BIRON
     Stoop, I say;
     Her shoulder is with child.
DUMAIN
     As fair as day.
BIRON
     Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
DUMAIN
     O that I had my wish!
LONGAVILLE
     And I had mine!
FERDINAND
     And I mine too, good Lord!
BIRON
     Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
DUMAIN
     I would forget her; but a fever she
     Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
BIRON
     A fever in your blood! why, then incision
     Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
DUMAIN
     Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
BIRON
     Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
DUMAIN
     [Reads]
     On a day--alack the day!--
     Love, whose month is ever May,
     Spied a blossom passing fair
     Playing in the wanton air:
     Through the velvet leaves the wind,
     All unseen, can passage find;
     That the lover, sick to death,
     Wish himself the heaven's breath.
     Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
     Air, would I might triumph so!
     But, alack, my hand is sworn
     Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
     Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
     Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
     Do not call it sin in me,
     That I am forsworn for thee;
     Thou for whom Jove would swear
     Juno but an Ethiope were;
     And deny himself for Jove,
     Turning mortal for thy love.
     This will I send, and something else more plain,
     That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
     O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
     Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
     Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
     For none offend where all alike do dote.
LONGAVILLE
     [Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
     You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
     To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
FERDINAND
     [Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
     You chide at him, offending twice as much;
     You do not love Maria; Longaville
     Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
     Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
     His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
     I have been closely shrouded in this bush
     And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
     I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
     Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
     Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
     One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
     To LONGAVILLE
     You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
     To DUMAIN
     And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
     What will Biron say when that he shall hear
     Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
     How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
     How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
     For all the wealth that ever I did see,
     I would not have him know so much by me.
BIRON
     Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
     Advancing
     Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
     Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
     These worms for loving, that art most in love?
     Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
     There is no certain princess that appears;
     You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
     Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
     But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
     All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
     You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
     But I a beam do find in each of three.
     O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
     Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
     O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
     To see a king transformed to a gnat!
     To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
     And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
     And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
     And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
     Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
     And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
     And where my liege's? all about the breast:
     A caudle, ho!
FERDINAND
     Too bitter is thy jest.
     Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
BIRON
     Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
     I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
     To break the vow I am engaged in;
     I am betray'd, by keeping company
     With men like men of inconstancy.
     When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
     Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
     In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
     Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
     A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
     A leg, a limb?
FERDINAND
     Soft! whither away so fast?
     A true man or a thief that gallops so?
BIRON
     I post from love: good lover, let me go.
     Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA
     God bless the king!
FERDINAND
     What present hast thou there?
COSTARD
     Some certain treason.
FERDINAND
     What makes treason here?
COSTARD
     Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
FERDINAND
     If it mar nothing neither,
     The treason and you go in peace away together.
JAQUENETTA
     I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
     Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
FERDINAND
     Biron, read it over.
     Giving him the paper
     Where hadst thou it?
JAQUENETTA
     Of Costard.
FERDINAND
     Where hadst thou it?
COSTARD
     Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
     BIRON tears the letter
FERDINAND
     How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
BIRON
     A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
LONGAVILLE
     It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
DUMAIN
     It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
     Gathering up the pieces
BIRON
     [To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
     born to do me shame.
     Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
FERDINAND
     What?
BIRON
     That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
     He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
     Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
     O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
DUMAIN
     Now the number is even.
BIRON
     True, true; we are four.
     Will these turtles be gone?
FERDINAND
     Hence, sirs; away!
COSTARD
     Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
     Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
BIRON
     Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
     As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
     The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
     Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
     We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
     Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
FERDINAND
     What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
BIRON
     Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
     That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
     At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
     Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
     Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
     What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
     Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
     That is not blinded by her majesty?
FERDINAND
     What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
     My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
     She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
BIRON
     My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
     O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
     Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
     Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
     Where several worthies make one dignity,
     Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
     Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
     Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
     To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
     She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
     A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
     Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
     Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
     And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
     O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
FERDINAND
     By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
BIRON
     Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
     A wife of such wood were felicity.
     O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
     That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
     If that she learn not of her eye to look:
     No face is fair that is not full so black.
FERDINAND
     O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
     The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
     And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
BIRON
     Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
     O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
     It mourns that painting and usurping hair
     Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
     And therefore is she born to make black fair.
     Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
     For native blood is counted painting now;
     And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
     Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
DUMAIN
     To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
LONGAVILLE
     And since her time are colliers counted bright.
FERDINAND
     And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
DUMAIN
     Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
BIRON
     Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
     For fear their colours should be wash'd away.
FERDINAND
     'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
     I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.
BIRON
     I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
FERDINAND
     No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
DUMAIN
     I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
LONGAVILLE
     Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
BIRON
     O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
     Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
DUMAIN
     O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
     The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
FERDINAND
     But what of this? are we not all in love?
BIRON
     Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
FERDINAND
     Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
     Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
DUMAIN
     Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
LONGAVILLE
     O, some authority how to proceed;
     Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
DUMAIN
     Some salve for perjury.
BIRON
     'Tis more than need.
     Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
     Consider what you first did swear unto,
     To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
     Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
     Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
     And abstinence engenders maladies.
     And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
     In that each of you have forsworn his book,
     Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
     For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
     Have found the ground of study's excellence
     Without the beauty of a woman's face?
     From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the
     books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
     Why, universal plodding poisons up
     The nimble spirits in the arteries,
     As motion and long-during action tires
     The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
     Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
     You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
     And study too, the causer of your vow;
     For where is any author in the world
     Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
     Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
     And where we are our learning likewise is:
     Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
     Do we not likewise see our learning there?
     O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
     And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
     For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
     In leaden contemplation have found out
     Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
     Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
     Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
     And therefore, finding barren practisers,
     Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
     But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
     Lives not alone immured in the brain;
     But, with the motion of all elements,
     Courses as swift as thought in every power,
     And gives to every power a double power,
     Above their functions and their offices.
     It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
     A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
     A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
     When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
     Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
     Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
     Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
     For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
     Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
     Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
     As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
     And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
     Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
     Never durst poet touch a pen to write
     Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
     O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
     And plant in tyrants mild humility.
     From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
     They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
     They are the books, the arts, the academes,
     That show, contain and nourish all the world:
     Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
     Then fools you were these women to forswear,
     Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
     For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
     Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
     Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
     Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
     Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
     Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
     It is religion to be thus forsworn,
     For charity itself fulfills the law,
     And who can sever love from charity?
FERDINAND
     Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
BIRON
     Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
     Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
     In conflict that you get the sun of them.
LONGAVILLE
     Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
     Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
FERDINAND
     And win them too: therefore let us devise
     Some entertainment for them in their tents.
BIRON
     First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
     Then homeward every man attach the hand
     Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
     We will with some strange pastime solace them,
     Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
     For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
     Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
FERDINAND
     Away, away! no time shall be omitted
     That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
BIRON
     Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
     And justice always whirls in equal measure:
     Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
     If so, our copper buys no better treasure.
     Exeunt
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. The same. ****
     Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL
HOLOFERNES
     Satis quod sufficit.
SIR NATHANIEL
     I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
     have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
     scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
     impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
     out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
     a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
     nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
HOLOFERNES
     Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
     discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
     ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
     behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
     too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
     were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
SIR NATHANIEL
     A most singular and choice epithet.
     Draws out his table-book
HOLOFERNES
     He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
     than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
     fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
     point-devise companions; such rackers of
     orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
     say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
     e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
     half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
     abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
     would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
     insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
SIR NATHANIEL
     Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
HOLOFERNES
     Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
     'twill serve.
SIR NATHANIEL
     Videsne quis venit?
HOLOFERNES
     Video, et gaudeo.
     Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Chirrah!
     To MOTH
HOLOFERNES
     Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Men of peace, well encountered.
HOLOFERNES
     Most military sir, salutation.
MOTH
     [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast
     of languages, and stolen the scraps.
COSTARD
     O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
     I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
     for thou art not so long by the head as
     honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
     swallowed than a flap-dragon.
MOTH
     Peace! the peal begins.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     [To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?
MOTH
     Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
     b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
HOLOFERNES
     Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
MOTH
     Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
HOLOFERNES
     Quis, quis, thou consonant?
MOTH
     The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
     the fifth, if I.
HOLOFERNES
     I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
MOTH
     The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
     touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
     home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
MOTH
     Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
HOLOFERNES
     What is the figure? what is the figure?
MOTH
     Horns.
HOLOFERNES
     Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
MOTH
     Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
     your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
COSTARD
     An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
     have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
     remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
     purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
     the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
     bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
     Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
     ends, as they say.
HOLOFERNES
     O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
     barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
     charge-house on the top of the mountain?
HOLOFERNES
     Or mons, the hill.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
HOLOFERNES
     I do, sans question.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
     affection to congratulate the princess at her
     pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
     rude multitude call the afternoon.
HOLOFERNES
     The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
     liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
     the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
     assure you, sir, I do assure.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
     I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
     inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
     remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
     head: and among other important and most serious
     designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
     that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
     grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
     shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
     with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
     heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
     fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
     greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
     travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
     The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
     implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
     present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
     delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
     antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
     curate and your sweet self are good at such
     eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
     were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
     crave your assistance.
HOLOFERNES
     Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
     Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
     show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
     our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
     gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
     the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
     Nine Worthies.
SIR NATHANIEL
     Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
HOLOFERNES
     Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
     Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
     limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
     page, Hercules,--
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
     that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
HOLOFERNES
     Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
     minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
     snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
MOTH
     An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
     hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
     crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
     offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     For the rest of the Worthies?--
HOLOFERNES
     I will play three myself.
MOTH
     Thrice-worthy gentleman!
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Shall I tell you a thing?
HOLOFERNES
     We attend.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
     beseech you, follow.
HOLOFERNES
     Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
DULL
     Nor understood none neither, sir.
HOLOFERNES
     Allons! we will employ thee.
DULL
     I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
     On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
HOLOFERNES
     Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
     Exeunt
     LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
**** SCENE II. The same. ****
     Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA
PRINCESS
     Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
     If fairings come thus plentifully in:
     A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
     Look you what I have from the loving king.
ROSALINE
     Madame, came nothing else along with that?
PRINCESS
     Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
     As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
     Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
     That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
ROSALINE
     That was the way to make his godhead wax,
     For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
KATHARINE
     Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
ROSALINE
     You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
KATHARINE
     He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
     And so she died: had she been light, like you,
     Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
     She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
     And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
ROSALINE
     What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
KATHARINE
     A light condition in a beauty dark.
ROSALINE
     We need more light to find your meaning out.
KATHARINE
     You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
     Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
ROSALINE
     Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
KATHARINE
     So do not you, for you are a light wench.
ROSALINE
     Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
KATHARINE
     You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
ROSALINE
     Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
PRINCESS
     Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
     But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
     Who sent it? and what is it?
ROSALINE
     I would you knew:
     An if my face were but as fair as yours,
     My favour were as great; be witness this.
     Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
     The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
     I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
     I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
     O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
PRINCESS
     Any thing like?
ROSALINE
     Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
PRINCESS
     Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
KATHARINE
     Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
ROSALINE
     'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
     My red dominical, my golden letter:
     O, that your face were not so full of O's!
KATHARINE
     A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
PRINCESS
     But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
KATHARINE
     Madam, this glove.
PRINCESS
     Did he not send you twain?
KATHARINE
     Yes, madam, and moreover
     Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
     A huge translation of hypocrisy,
     Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
MARIA
     This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
     The letter is too long by half a mile.
PRINCESS
     I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
     The chain were longer and the letter short?
MARIA
     Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
PRINCESS
     We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
ROSALINE
     They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
     That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
     O that I knew he were but in by the week!
     How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
     And wait the season and observe the times
     And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
     And shape his service wholly to my hests
     And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
     So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
     That he should be my fool and I his fate.
PRINCESS
     None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
     As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
     Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
     And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
ROSALINE
     The blood of youth burns not with such excess
     As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
MARIA
     Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
     As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
     Since all the power thereof it doth apply
     To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
PRINCESS
     Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
     Enter BOYET
BOYET
     O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
PRINCESS
     Thy news Boyet?
BOYET
     Prepare, madam, prepare!
     Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
     Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
     Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
     Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
     Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
PRINCESS
     Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
     That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
BOYET
     Under the cool shade of a sycamore
     I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
     When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
     Toward that shade I might behold addrest
     The king and his companions: warily
     I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
     And overheard what you shall overhear,
     That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
     Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
     That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
     Action and accent did they teach him there;
     'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
     And ever and anon they made a doubt
     Presence majestical would put him out,
     'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
     Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
     The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
     I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
     With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
     Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
     One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
     A better speech was never spoke before;
     Another, with his finger and his thumb,
     Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
     The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
     The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
     With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
     With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
     That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
     To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
PRINCESS
     But what, but what, come they to visit us?
BOYET
     They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
     Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
     Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
     And every one his love-feat will advance
     Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
     By favours several which they did bestow.
PRINCESS
     And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
     For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
     And not a man of them shall have the grace,
     Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
     Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
     And then the king will court thee for his dear;
     Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
     So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
     And change your favours too; so shall your loves
     Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
ROSALINE
     Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
KATHARINE
     But in this changing what is your intent?
PRINCESS
     The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
     They do it but in mocking merriment;
     And mock for mock is only my intent.
     Their several counsels they unbosom shall
     To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
     Upon the next occasion that we meet,
     With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
ROSALINE
     But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
PRINCESS
     No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
     Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
     But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
BOYET
     Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
     And quite divorce his memory from his part.
PRINCESS
     Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
     The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
     There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
     To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
     So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
     And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
     Trumpets sound within
BOYET
     The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
     The Ladies mask
     Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and
     DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked
MOTH
     All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
BOYET
     Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
MOTH
     A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
     The Ladies turn their backs to him
     That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
BIRON
     [Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
MOTH
     That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
BOYET
     True; out indeed.
MOTH
     Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
     Not to behold--
BIRON
     [Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.
MOTH
     Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
     --with your sun-beamed eyes--
BOYET
     They will not answer to that epithet;
     You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
MOTH
     They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
BIRON
     Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
     Exit MOTH
ROSALINE
     What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
     If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
     That some plain man recount their purposes
     Know what they would.
BOYET
     What would you with the princess?
BIRON
     Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
ROSALINE
     What would they, say they?
BOYET
     Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
ROSALINE
     Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
BOYET
     She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
FERDINAND
     Say to her, we have measured many miles
     To tread a measure with her on this grass.
BOYET
     They say, that they have measured many a mile
     To tread a measure with you on this grass.
ROSALINE
     It is not so. Ask them how many inches
     Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
     The measure then of one is easily told.
BOYET
     If to come hither you have measured miles,
     And many miles, the princess bids you tell
     How many inches doth fill up one mile.
BIRON
     Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
BOYET
     She hears herself.
ROSALINE
     How many weary steps,
     Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
     Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
BIRON
     We number nothing that we spend for you:
     Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
     That we may do it still without accompt.
     Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
     That we, like savages, may worship it.
ROSALINE
     My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
FERDINAND
     Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
     Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
     Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
ROSALINE
     O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
     Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
FERDINAND
     Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
     Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
ROSALINE
     Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
     Music plays
     Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
FERDINAND
     Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
ROSALINE
     You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
FERDINAND
     Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
     The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
ROSALINE
     Our ears vouchsafe it.
FERDINAND
     But your legs should do it.
ROSALINE
     Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
     We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
FERDINAND
     Why take we hands, then?
ROSALINE
     Only to part friends:
     Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
FERDINAND
     More measure of this measure; be not nice.
ROSALINE
     We can afford no more at such a price.
FERDINAND
     Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
ROSALINE
     Your absence only.
FERDINAND
     That can never be.
ROSALINE
     Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
     Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
FERDINAND
     If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
ROSALINE
     In private, then.
FERDINAND
     I am best pleased with that.
     They converse apart
BIRON
     White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
PRINCESS
     Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
BIRON
     Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
     Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
     There's half-a-dozen sweets.
PRINCESS
     Seventh sweet, adieu:
     Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
BIRON
     One word in secret.
PRINCESS
     Let it not be sweet.
BIRON
     Thou grievest my gall.
PRINCESS
     Gall! bitter.
BIRON
     Therefore meet.
     They converse apart
DUMAIN
     Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
MARIA
     Name it.
DUMAIN
     Fair lady,--
MARIA
     Say you so? Fair lord,--
     Take that for your fair lady.
DUMAIN
     Please it you,
     As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
     They converse apart
KATHARINE
     What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
LONGAVILLE
     I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
KATHARINE
     O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
LONGAVILLE
     You have a double tongue within your mask,
     And would afford my speechless vizard half.
KATHARINE
     Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
LONGAVILLE
     A calf, fair lady!
KATHARINE
     No, a fair lord calf.
LONGAVILLE
     Let's part the word.
KATHARINE
     No, I'll not be your half
     Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
LONGAVILLE
     Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
     Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
KATHARINE
     Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
LONGAVILLE
     One word in private with you, ere I die.
KATHARINE
     Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
     They converse apart
BOYET
     The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
     As is the razor's edge invisible,
     Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
     Above the sense of sense; so sensible
     Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
     Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
ROSALINE
     Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
BIRON
     By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
FERDINAND
     Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
PRINCESS
     Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
     Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors
     Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
BOYET
     Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
ROSALINE
     Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
PRINCESS
     O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
     Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
     Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
     This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
ROSALINE
     O, they were all in lamentable cases!
     The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
PRINCESS
     Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
MARIA
     Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
     No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
KATHARINE
     Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
     And trow you what he called me?
PRINCESS
     Qualm, perhaps.
KATHARINE
     Yes, in good faith.
PRINCESS
     Go, sickness as thou art!
ROSALINE
     Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
     But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
PRINCESS
     And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
KATHARINE
     And Longaville was for my service born.
MARIA
     Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
BOYET
     Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
     Immediately they will again be here
     In their own shapes; for it can never be
     They will digest this harsh indignity.
PRINCESS
     Will they return?
BOYET
     They will, they will, God knows,
     And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
     Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
     Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
PRINCESS
     How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
BOYET
     Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
     Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
     Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
PRINCESS
     Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
     If they return in their own shapes to woo?
ROSALINE
     Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
     Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
     Let us complain to them what fools were here,
     Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
     And wonder what they were and to what end
     Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
     And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
     Should be presented at our tent to us.
BOYET
     Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
PRINCESS
     Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
     Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA
     Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper
     habits
FERDINAND
     Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
BOYET
     Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
     Command me any service to her thither?
FERDINAND
     That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
BOYET
     I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
     Exit
BIRON
     This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
     And utters it again when God doth please:
     He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
     At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
     And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
     Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
     This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
     Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
     A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
     That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
     This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
     That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
     In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
     A mean most meanly; and in ushering
     Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
     The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
     This is the flower that smiles on every one,
     To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
     And consciences, that will not die in debt,
     Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
FERDINAND
     A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
     That put Armado's page out of his part!
BIRON
     See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
     Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
     Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and
     KATHARINE
FERDINAND
     All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
PRINCESS
     'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
FERDINAND
     Construe my speeches better, if you may.
PRINCESS
     Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
FERDINAND
     We came to visit you, and purpose now
     To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
PRINCESS
     This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
     Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
FERDINAND
     Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
     The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
PRINCESS
     You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
     For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
     Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
     As the unsullied lily, I protest,
     A world of torments though I should endure,
     I would not yield to be your house's guest;
     So much I hate a breaking cause to be
     Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
FERDINAND
     O, you have lived in desolation here,
     Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
PRINCESS
     Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
     We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
     A mess of Russians left us but of late.
FERDINAND
     How, madam! Russians!
PRINCESS
     Ay, in truth, my lord;
     Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
ROSALINE
     Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
     My lady, to the manner of the days,
     In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
     We four indeed confronted were with four
     In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
     And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
     They did not bless us with one happy word.
     I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
     When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
BIRON
     This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
     Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
     With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
     By light we lose light: your capacity
     Is of that nature that to your huge store
     Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
ROSALINE
     This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
BIRON
     I am a fool, and full of poverty.
ROSALINE
     But that you take what doth to you belong,
     It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
BIRON
     O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
ROSALINE
     All the fool mine?
BIRON
     I cannot give you less.
ROSALINE
     Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
BIRON
     Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
ROSALINE
     There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
     That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
FERDINAND
     We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
DUMAIN
     Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
PRINCESS
     Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
ROSALINE
     Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
     Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
BIRON
     Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
     Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I
     lady, dart thy skill at me;
     Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
     Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
     Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
     And I will wish thee never more to dance,
     Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
     O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
     Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
     Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
     Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
     Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
     Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
     Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
     Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
     I do forswear them; and I here protest,
     By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
     Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
     In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
     And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
     My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
ROSALINE
     Sans sans, I pray you.
BIRON
     Yet I have a trick
     Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
     I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
     Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
     They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
     They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
     These lords are visited; you are not free,
     For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
PRINCESS
     No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
BIRON
     Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
ROSALINE
     It is not so; for how can this be true,
     That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
BIRON
     Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
ROSALINE
     Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
BIRON
     Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
FERDINAND
     Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
     Some fair excuse.
PRINCESS
     The fairest is confession.
     Were not you here but even now disguised?
FERDINAND
     Madam, I was.
PRINCESS
     And were you well advised?
FERDINAND
     I was, fair madam.
PRINCESS
     When you then were here,
     What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
FERDINAND
     That more than all the world I did respect her.
PRINCESS
     When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
FERDINAND
     Upon mine honour, no.
PRINCESS
     Peace, peace! forbear:
     Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
FERDINAND
     Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
PRINCESS
     I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
     What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
ROSALINE
     Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
     As precious eyesight, and did value me
     Above this world; adding thereto moreover
     That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
PRINCESS
     God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
     Most honourably doth unhold his word.
FERDINAND
     What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
     I never swore this lady such an oath.
ROSALINE
     By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
     You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
FERDINAND
     My faith and this the princess I did give:
     I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
PRINCESS
     Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
     And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
     What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
BIRON
     Neither of either; I remit both twain.
     I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
     Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
     To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
     Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
     Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
     That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
     To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
     Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
     The ladies did change favours: and then we,
     Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
     Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
     We are again forsworn, in will and error.
     Much upon this it is: and might not you
     To BOYET
     Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
     Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
     And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
     And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
     Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
     You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
     Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
     You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
     Wounds like a leaden sword.
BOYET
     Full merrily
     Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
BIRON
     Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
     Enter COSTARD
     Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
COSTARD
     O Lord, sir, they would know
     Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
BIRON
     What, are there but three?
COSTARD
     No, sir; but it is vara fine,
     For every one pursents three.
BIRON
     And three times thrice is nine.
COSTARD
     Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
     You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
     what we know:
     I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
BIRON
     Is not nine.
COSTARD
     Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
BIRON
     By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
COSTARD
     O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
     by reckoning, sir.
BIRON
     How much is it?
COSTARD
     O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
     sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
     own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
     in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
BIRON
     Art thou one of the Worthies?
COSTARD
     It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
     Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
     the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
BIRON
     Go, bid them prepare.
COSTARD
     We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
     some care.
     Exit
FERDINAND
     Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
BIRON
     We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
     To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
FERDINAND
     I say they shall not come.
PRINCESS
     Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
     That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
     Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
     Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
     Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
     When great things labouring perish in their birth.
BIRON
     A right description of our sport, my lord.
     Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
     sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
     Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper
PRINCESS
     Doth this man serve God?
BIRON
     Why ask you?
PRINCESS
     He speaks not like a man of God's making.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
     I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
     fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
     will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
     I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
     Exit
FERDINAND
     Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
     presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
     Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
     Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
     these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
     These four will change habits, and present the other five.
BIRON
     There is five in the first show.
FERDINAND
     You are deceived; 'tis not so.
BIRON
     The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
     and the boy:--
     Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
     Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.
FERDINAND
     The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
     Enter COSTARD, for Pompey
COSTARD
     I Pompey am,--
BOYET
     You lie, you are not he.
COSTARD
     I Pompey am,--
BOYET
     With libbard's head on knee.
BIRON
     Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
     with thee.
COSTARD
     I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
DUMAIN
     The Great.
COSTARD
     It is, 'Great,' sir:--
     Pompey surnamed the Great;
     That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
     my foe to sweat:
     And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
     And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
     If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
PRINCESS
     Great thanks, great Pompey.
COSTARD
     'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
     made a little fault in 'Great.'
BIRON
     My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
     Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander
SIR NATHANIEL
     When in the world I lived, I was the world's
     commander;
     By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
     conquering might:
     My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--
BOYET
     Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.
BIRON
     Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
PRINCESS
     The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.
SIR NATHANIEL
     When in the world I lived, I was the world's
     commander,--
BOYET
     Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.
BIRON
     Pompey the Great,--
COSTARD
     Your servant, and Costard.
BIRON
     Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
COSTARD
     [To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown
     Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
     the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
     his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
     to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
     and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
     SIR NATHANIEL retires
     There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
     honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
     marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
     bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
     'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
     a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
     Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules
HOLOFERNES
     Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
     Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
     And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
     Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
     Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
     Ergo I come with this apology.
     Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
     MOTH retires
     Judas I am,--
DUMAIN
     A Judas!
HOLOFERNES
     Not Iscariot, sir.
     Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.
DUMAIN
     Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
BIRON
     A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
HOLOFERNES
     Judas I am,--
DUMAIN
     The more shame for you, Judas.
HOLOFERNES
     What mean you, sir?
BOYET
     To make Judas hang himself.
HOLOFERNES
     Begin, sir; you are my elder.
BIRON
     Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
HOLOFERNES
     I will not be put out of countenance.
BIRON
     Because thou hast no face.
HOLOFERNES
     What is this?
BOYET
     A cittern-head.
DUMAIN
     The head of a bodkin.
BIRON
     A Death's face in a ring.
LONGAVILLE
     The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
BOYET
     The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
DUMAIN
     The carved-bone face on a flask.
BIRON
     Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
DUMAIN
     Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
BIRON
     Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
     And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
HOLOFERNES
     You have put me out of countenance.
BIRON
     False; we have given thee faces.
HOLOFERNES
     But you have out-faced them all.
BIRON
     An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
BOYET
     Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
     And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
DUMAIN
     For the latter end of his name.
BIRON
     For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!
HOLOFERNES
     This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
BOYET
     A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
     HOLOFERNES retires
PRINCESS
     Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
     Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector
BIRON
     Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
DUMAIN
     Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
FERDINAND
     Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
BOYET
     But is this Hector?
FERDINAND
     I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
LONGAVILLE
     His leg is too big for Hector's.
DUMAIN
     More calf, certain.
BOYET
     No; he is best endued in the small.
BIRON
     This cannot be Hector.
DUMAIN
     He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
     Gave Hector a gift,--
DUMAIN
     A gilt nutmeg.
BIRON
     A lemon.
LONGAVILLE
     Stuck with cloves.
DUMAIN
     No, cloven.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Peace!--
     The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
     Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
     A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
     From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
     I am that flower,--
DUMAIN
     That mint.
LONGAVILLE
     That columbine.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
LONGAVILLE
     I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
DUMAIN
     Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
     beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
     he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
     To the PRINCESS
     Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
PRINCESS
     Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
BOYET
     [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,--
DUMAIN
     [Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
COSTARD
     The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
     is two months on her way.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     What meanest thou?
COSTARD
     Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
     wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
     her belly already: tis yours.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
     die.
COSTARD
     Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
     quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
     him.
DUMAIN
     Most rare Pompey!
BOYET
     Renowned Pompey!
BIRON
     Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
     Pompey the Huge!
DUMAIN
     Hector trembles.
BIRON
     Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
     on! stir them on!
DUMAIN
     Hector will challenge him.
BIRON
     Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
     sup a flea.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
COSTARD
     I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
     I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
     let me borrow my arms again.
DUMAIN
     Room for the incensed Worthies!
COSTARD
     I'll do it in my shirt.
DUMAIN
     Most resolute Pompey!
MOTH
     Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
     not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
     you? You will lose your reputation.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
     in my shirt.
DUMAIN
     You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
BIRON
     What reason have you for't?
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
     woolward for penance.
BOYET
     True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
     linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
     a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
     his heart for a favour.
     Enter MERCADE
MERCADE
     God save you, madam!
PRINCESS
     Welcome, Mercade;
     But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
MERCADE
     I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
     Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
PRINCESS
     Dead, for my life!
MERCADE
     Even so; my tale is told.
BIRON
     Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
     seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
     discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
     Exeunt Worthies
FERDINAND
     How fares your majesty?
PRINCESS
     Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
FERDINAND
     Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
PRINCESS
     Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
     For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
     Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
     In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
     The liberal opposition of our spirits,
     If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
     In the converse of breath: your gentleness
     Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
     A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
     Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
     For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
FERDINAND
     The extreme parts of time extremely forms
     All causes to the purpose of his speed,
     And often at his very loose decides
     That which long process could not arbitrate:
     And though the mourning brow of progeny
     Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
     The holy suit which fain it would convince,
     Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
     Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
     From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
     Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
     As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
PRINCESS
     I understand you not: my griefs are double.
BIRON
     Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
     And by these badges understand the king.
     For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
     Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
     Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
     Even to the opposed end of our intents:
     And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
     As love is full of unbefitting strains,
     All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
     Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
     Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
     Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
     To every varied object in his glance:
     Which parti-coated presence of loose love
     Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
     Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
     Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
     Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
     Our love being yours, the error that love makes
     Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
     By being once false for ever to be true
     To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
     And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
     Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
PRINCESS
     We have received your letters full of love;
     Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
     And, in our maiden council, rated them
     At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
     As bombast and as lining to the time:
     But more devout than this in our respects
     Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
     In their own fashion, like a merriment.
DUMAIN
     Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
LONGAVILLE
     So did our looks.
ROSALINE
     We did not quote them so.
FERDINAND
     Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
     Grant us your loves.
PRINCESS
     A time, methinks, too short
     To make a world-without-end bargain in.
     No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
     Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
     If for my love, as there is no such cause,
     You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
     Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
     To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
     Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
     There stay until the twelve celestial signs
     Have brought about the annual reckoning.
     If this austere insociable life
     Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
     If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
     Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
     But that it bear this trial and last love;
     Then, at the expiration of the year,
     Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
     And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
     I will be thine; and till that instant shut
     My woeful self up in a mourning house,
     Raining the tears of lamentation
     For the remembrance of my father's death.
     If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
     Neither entitled in the other's heart.
FERDINAND
     If this, or more than this, I would deny,
     To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
     The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
     Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
DUMAIN
     But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
KATHARINE
     A beard, fair health, and honesty;
     With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
DUMAIN
     O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
KATHARINE
     Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
     I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
     Come when the king doth to my lady come;
     Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
DUMAIN
     I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
KATHARINE
     Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
LONGAVILLE
     What says Maria?
MARIA
     At the twelvemonth's end
     I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
LONGAVILLE
     I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
MARIA
     The liker you; few taller are so young.
BIRON
     Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
     Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
     What humble suit attends thy answer there:
     Impose some service on me for thy love.
ROSALINE
     Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
     Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
     Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
     Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
     Which you on all estates will execute
     That lie within the mercy of your wit.
     To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
     And therewithal to win me, if you please,
     Without the which I am not to be won,
     You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
     Visit the speechless sick and still converse
     With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
     With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
     To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
BIRON
     To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
     It cannot be; it is impossible:
     Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
ROSALINE
     Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
     Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
     Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
     A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
     Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
     Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
     Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
     Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
     And I will have you and that fault withal;
     But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
     And I shall find you empty of that fault,
     Right joyful of your reformation.
BIRON
     A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
     I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
PRINCESS
     [To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
FERDINAND
     No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
BIRON
     Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
     Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
     Might well have made our sport a comedy.
FERDINAND
     Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
     And then 'twill end.
BIRON
     That's too long for a play.
     Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--
PRINCESS
     Was not that Hector?
DUMAIN
     The worthy knight of Troy.
     DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
     I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
     a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
     plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
     esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
     the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
     owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
     end of our show.
FERDINAND
     Call them forth quickly; we will do so.

     Holla! approach.
     Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and others
     This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
     the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
     cuckoo. Ver, begin.
     THE SONG
     SPRING.
     When daisies pied and violets blue
     And lady-smocks all silver-white
     And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
     Do paint the meadows with delight,
     The cuckoo then, on every tree,
     Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
     Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
     Unpleasing to a married ear!
     When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
     And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
     When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
     And maidens bleach their summer smocks
     The cuckoo then, on every tree,
     Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
     Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
     Unpleasing to a married ear!
     WINTER.
     When icicles hang by the wall
     And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
     And Tom bears logs into the hall
     And milk comes frozen home in pail,
     When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
     Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
     Tu-who, a merry note,
     While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
     When all aloud the wind doth blow
     And coughing drowns the parson's saw
     And birds sit brooding in the snow
     And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
     When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
     Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
     Tu-who, a merry note,
     While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
PHILO
     Nay, but this dotage of our general's
     O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
     That o'er the files and musters of the war
     Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
     The office and devotion of their view
     Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
     Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
     The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
     And is become the bellows and the fan
     To cool a gipsy's lust.
     Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with
     Eunuchs fanning her
     Look, where they come:
     Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
     The triple pillar of the world transform'd
     Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
CLEOPATRA
     If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
MARK ANTONY
     There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
CLEOPATRA
     I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
MARK ANTONY
     Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
     Enter an Attendant
Attendant
     News, my good lord, from Rome.
MARK ANTONY
     Grates me: the sum.
CLEOPATRA
     Nay, hear them, Antony:
     Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
     If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
     His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
     Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
     Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
MARK ANTONY
     How, my love!
CLEOPATRA
     Perchance! nay, and most like:
     You must not stay here longer, your dismission
     Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
     Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
     Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
     Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
     Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
     When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
MARK ANTONY
     Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
     Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
     Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
     Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
     Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
     Embracing
     And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
     On pain of punishment, the world to weet
     We stand up peerless.
CLEOPATRA
     Excellent falsehood!
     Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
     I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
     Will be himself.
MARK ANTONY
     But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
     Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
     Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
     There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
     Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
CLEOPATRA
     Hear the ambassadors.
MARK ANTONY
     Fie, wrangling queen!
     Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
     To weep; whose every passion fully strives
     To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
     No messenger, but thine; and all alone
     To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
     The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
     Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
     Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train
DEMETRIUS
     Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
PHILO
     Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
     He comes too short of that great property
     Which still should go with Antony.
DEMETRIUS
     I am full sorry
     That he approves the common liar, who
     Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
     Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

**** SCENE II. The same. Another room. ****
     Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer
CHARMIAN
     Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
     almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
     that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
     this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
     with garlands!
ALEXAS
     Soothsayer!
Soothsayer
     Your will?
CHARMIAN
     Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
Soothsayer
     In nature's infinite book of secrecy
     A little I can read.
ALEXAS
     Show him your hand.
     Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
     Cleopatra's health to drink.
CHARMIAN
     Good sir, give me good fortune.
Soothsayer
     I make not, but foresee.
CHARMIAN
     Pray, then, foresee me one.
Soothsayer
     You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
CHARMIAN
     He means in flesh.
IRAS
     No, you shall paint when you are old.
CHARMIAN
     Wrinkles forbid!
ALEXAS
     Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
CHARMIAN
     Hush!
Soothsayer
     You shall be more beloving than beloved.
CHARMIAN
     I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
ALEXAS
     Nay, hear him.
CHARMIAN
     Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
     to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
     let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
     may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
     Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
Soothsayer
     You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
CHARMIAN
     O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
Soothsayer
     You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
     Than that which is to approach.
CHARMIAN
     Then belike my children shall have no names:
     prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
Soothsayer
     If every of your wishes had a womb.
     And fertile every wish, a million.
CHARMIAN
     Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
ALEXAS
     You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
CHARMIAN
     Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
ALEXAS
     We'll know all our fortunes.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
     be--drunk to bed.
IRAS
     There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
CHARMIAN
     E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
IRAS
     Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
CHARMIAN
     Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
     prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
     tell her but a worky-day fortune.
Soothsayer
     Your fortunes are alike.
IRAS
     But how, but how? give me particulars.
Soothsayer
     I have said.
IRAS
     Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
CHARMIAN
     Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
     I, where would you choose it?
IRAS
     Not in my husband's nose.
CHARMIAN
     Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
     his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
     that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
     her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
     follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
     laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
     Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
     matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
IRAS
     Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
     for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
     loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
     foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
     decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
CHARMIAN
     Amen.
ALEXAS
     Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
     cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
     they'ld do't!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Hush! here comes Antony.
CHARMIAN
     Not he; the queen.
     Enter CLEOPATRA
CLEOPATRA
     Saw you my lord?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     No, lady.
CLEOPATRA
     Was he not here?
CHARMIAN
     No, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
     A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Madam?
CLEOPATRA
     Seek him, and bring him hither.
     Where's Alexas?
ALEXAS
     Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
CLEOPATRA
     We will not look upon him: go with us.
     Exeunt
     Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants
Messenger
     Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
MARK ANTONY
     Against my brother Lucius?
Messenger
     Ay:
     But soon that war had end, and the time's state
     Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
     Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
     Upon the first encounter, drave them.
MARK ANTONY
     Well, what worst?
Messenger
     The nature of bad news infects the teller.
MARK ANTONY
     When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
     Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
     Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
     I hear him as he flatter'd.
Messenger
     Labienus--
     This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
     Extended Asia from Euphrates;
     His conquering banner shook from Syria
     To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
MARK ANTONY
     Antony, thou wouldst say,--
Messenger
     O, my lord!
MARK ANTONY
     Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
     Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
     Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
     With such full licence as both truth and malice
     Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
     When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
     Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
Messenger
     At your noble pleasure.
     Exit
MARK ANTONY
     From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
First Attendant
     The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
Second Attendant
     He stays upon your will.
MARK ANTONY
     Let him appear.
     These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
     Or lose myself in dotage.
     Enter another Messenger
     What are you?
Second Messenger
     Fulvia thy wife is dead.
MARK ANTONY
     Where died she?
Second Messenger
     In Sicyon:
     Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
     Importeth thee to know, this bears.
     Gives a letter
MARK ANTONY
     Forbear me.
     Exit Second Messenger
     There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
     What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
     We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
     By revolution lowering, does become
     The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
     The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
     I must from this enchanting queen break off:
     Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
     My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
     Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     What's your pleasure, sir?
MARK ANTONY
     I must with haste from hence.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Why, then, we kill all our women:
     we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
     if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
MARK ANTONY
     I must be gone.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
     pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
     them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
     nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
     this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
     times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
     mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
     her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
MARK ANTONY
     She is cunning past man's thought.
     Exit ALEXAS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
     the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
     winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
     storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
     cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
     shower of rain as well as Jove.
MARK ANTONY
     Would I had never seen her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
     of work; which not to have been blest withal would
     have discredited your travel.
MARK ANTONY
     Fulvia is dead.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Sir?
MARK ANTONY
     Fulvia is dead.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Fulvia!
MARK ANTONY
     Dead.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
     it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
     from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
     comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
     out, there are members to make new. If there were
     no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
     and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
     with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
     petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
     that should water this sorrow.
MARK ANTONY
     The business she hath broached in the state
     Cannot endure my absence.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     And the business you have broached here cannot be
     without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
     wholly depends on your abode.
MARK ANTONY
     No more light answers. Let our officers
     Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
     The cause of our expedience to the queen,
     And get her leave to part. For not alone
     The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
     Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
     Of many our contriving friends in Rome
     Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
     Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
     The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
     Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
     Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
     Pompey the Great and all his dignities
     Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
     Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
     For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
     The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
     Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
     And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
     To such whose place is under us, requires
     Our quick remove from hence.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I shall do't.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The same. Another room. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA
     Where is he?
CHARMIAN
     I did not see him since.
CLEOPATRA
     See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
     I did not send you: if you find him sad,
     Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
     That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
     Exit ALEXAS
CHARMIAN
     Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
     You do not hold the method to enforce
     The like from him.
CLEOPATRA
     What should I do, I do not?
CHARMIAN
     In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.
CLEOPATRA
     Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
CHARMIAN
     Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
     In time we hate that which we often fear.
     But here comes Antony.
     Enter MARK ANTONY
CLEOPATRA
     I am sick and sullen.
MARK ANTONY
     I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--
CLEOPATRA
     Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
     It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
     Will not sustain it.
MARK ANTONY
     Now, my dearest queen,--
CLEOPATRA
     Pray you, stand further from me.
MARK ANTONY
     What's the matter?
CLEOPATRA
     I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
     What says the married woman? You may go:
     Would she had never given you leave to come!
     Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
     I have no power upon you; hers you are.
MARK ANTONY
     The gods best know,--
CLEOPATRA
     O, never was there queen
     So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
     I saw the treasons planted.
MARK ANTONY
     Cleopatra,--
CLEOPATRA
     Why should I think you can be mine and true,
     Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
     Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
     To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
     Which break themselves in swearing!
MARK ANTONY
     Most sweet queen,--
CLEOPATRA
     Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
     But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
     Then was the time for words: no going then;
     Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
     Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
     But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
     Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
     Art turn'd the greatest liar.
MARK ANTONY
     How now, lady!
CLEOPATRA
     I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
     There were a heart in Egypt.
MARK ANTONY
     Hear me, queen:
     The strong necessity of time commands
     Our services awhile; but my full heart
     Remains in use with you. Our Italy
     Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
     Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
     Equality of two domestic powers
     Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
     Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
     Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
     Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
     Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
     And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
     By any desperate change: my more particular,
     And that which most with you should safe my going,
     Is Fulvia's death.
CLEOPATRA
     Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
     It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
MARK ANTONY
     She's dead, my queen:
     Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
     The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
     See when and where she died.
CLEOPATRA
     O most false love!
     Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
     With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
     In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
MARK ANTONY
     Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
     The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
     As you shall give the advice. By the fire
     That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
     Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
     As thou affect'st.
CLEOPATRA
     Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
     But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
     So Antony loves.
MARK ANTONY
     My precious queen, forbear;
     And give true evidence to his love, which stands
     An honourable trial.
CLEOPATRA
     So Fulvia told me.
     I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
     Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
     Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
     Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
     Life perfect honour.
MARK ANTONY
     You'll heat my blood: no more.
CLEOPATRA
     You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
MARK ANTONY
     Now, by my sword,--
CLEOPATRA
     And target. Still he mends;
     But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
     How this Herculean Roman does become
     The carriage of his chafe.
MARK ANTONY
     I'll leave you, lady.
CLEOPATRA
     Courteous lord, one word.
     Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
     Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
     That you know well: something it is I would,
     O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
     And I am all forgotten.
MARK ANTONY
     But that your royalty
     Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
     For idleness itself.
CLEOPATRA
     'Tis sweating labour
     To bear such idleness so near the heart
     As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
     Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
     Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
     Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
     And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
     Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
     Be strew'd before your feet!
MARK ANTONY
     Let us go. Come;
     Our separation so abides, and flies,
     That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
     And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
     It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
     Our great competitor: from Alexandria
     This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
     The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
     Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
     More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
     Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
     A man who is the abstract of all faults
     That all men follow.
LEPIDUS
     I must not think there are
     Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
     His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
     More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
     Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
     Than what he chooses.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
     Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
     To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
     And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
     To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
     With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
     becomes him,--
     As his composure must be rare indeed
     Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
     No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
     So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
     His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
     Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
     Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
     That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
     As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
     As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
     Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
     And so rebel to judgment.
     Enter a Messenger
LEPIDUS
     Here's more news.
Messenger
     Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
     Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
     How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
     And it appears he is beloved of those
     That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
     The discontents repair, and men's reports
     Give him much wrong'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I should have known no less.
     It hath been taught us from the primal state,
     That he which is was wish'd until he were;
     And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
     Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
     Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
     Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
     To rot itself with motion.
Messenger
     Caesar, I bring thee word,
     Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
     Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
     With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
     They make in Italy; the borders maritime
     Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
     No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
     Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
     Than could his war resisted.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Antony,
     Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
     Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
     Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
     Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
     Though daintily brought up, with patience more
     Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
     The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
     Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
     The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
     Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
     The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
     It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
     Which some did die to look on: and all this--
     It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
     Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
     So much as lank'd not.
LEPIDUS
     'Tis pity of him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Let his shames quickly
     Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
     Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
     Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
     Thrives in our idleness.
LEPIDUS
     To-morrow, Caesar,
     I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
     Both what by sea and land I can be able
     To front this present time.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Till which encounter,
     It is my business too. Farewell.
LEPIDUS
     Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
     Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
     To let me be partaker.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Doubt not, sir;
     I knew it for my bond.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA
     Charmian!
CHARMIAN
     Madam?
CLEOPATRA
     Ha, ha!
     Give me to drink mandragora.
CHARMIAN
     Why, madam?
CLEOPATRA
     That I might sleep out this great gap of time
     My Antony is away.
CHARMIAN
     You think of him too much.
CLEOPATRA
     O, 'tis treason!
CHARMIAN
     Madam, I trust, not so.
CLEOPATRA
     Thou, eunuch Mardian!
MARDIAN
     What's your highness' pleasure?
CLEOPATRA
     Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
     In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
     That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
     May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
MARDIAN
     Yes, gracious madam.
CLEOPATRA
     Indeed!
MARDIAN
     Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
     But what indeed is honest to be done:
     Yet have I fierce affections, and think
     What Venus did with Mars.
CLEOPATRA
     O Charmian,
     Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
     Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
     O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
     Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
     The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
     And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
     Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
     For so he calls me: now I feed myself
     With most delicious poison. Think on me,
     That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
     And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
     When thou wast here above the ground, I was
     A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
     Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
     There would he anchor his aspect and die
     With looking on his life.
     Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR
ALEXAS
     Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
CLEOPATRA
     How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
     Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
     With his tinct gilded thee.
     How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
ALEXAS
     Last thing he did, dear queen,
     He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
     This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
CLEOPATRA
     Mine ear must pluck it thence.
ALEXAS
     'Good friend,' quoth he,
     'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
     This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
     To mend the petty present, I will piece
     Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
     Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
     And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
     Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
     Was beastly dumb'd by him.
CLEOPATRA
     What, was he sad or merry?
ALEXAS
     Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
     Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
CLEOPATRA
     O well-divided disposition! Note him,
     Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
     He was not sad, for he would shine on those
     That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
     Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
     In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
     O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
     The violence of either thee becomes,
     So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
ALEXAS
     Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
     Why do you send so thick?
CLEOPATRA
     Who's born that day
     When I forget to send to Antony,
     Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
     Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
     Ever love Caesar so?
CHARMIAN
     O that brave Caesar!
CLEOPATRA
     Be choked with such another emphasis!
     Say, the brave Antony.
CHARMIAN
     The valiant Caesar!
CLEOPATRA
     By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
     If thou with Caesar paragon again
     My man of men.
CHARMIAN
     By your most gracious pardon,
     I sing but after you.
CLEOPATRA
     My salad days,
     When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
     To say as I said then! But, come, away;
     Get me ink and paper:
     He shall have every day a several greeting,
     Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house. ****
     Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner
POMPEY
     If the great gods be just, they shall assist
     The deeds of justest men.
MENECRATES
     Know, worthy Pompey,
     That what they do delay, they not deny.
POMPEY
     Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
     The thing we sue for.
MENECRATES
     We, ignorant of ourselves,
     Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
     Deny us for our good; so find we profit
     By losing of our prayers.
POMPEY
     I shall do well:
     The people love me, and the sea is mine;
     My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
     Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
     In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
     No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
     He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
     Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
     Nor either cares for him.
MENAS
     Caesar and Lepidus
     Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
POMPEY
     Where have you this? 'tis false.
MENAS
     From Silvius, sir.
POMPEY
     He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
     Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
     Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
     Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
     Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
     Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
     Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
     That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
     Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
     Enter VARRIUS
     How now, Varrius!
VARRIUS
     This is most certain that I shall deliver:
     Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
     Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
     A space for further travel.
POMPEY
     I could have given less matter
     A better ear. Menas, I did not think
     This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
     For such a petty war: his soldiership
     Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
     The higher our opinion, that our stirring
     Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
     The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
MENAS
     I cannot hope
     Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
     His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
     His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
     Not moved by Antony.
POMPEY
     I know not, Menas,
     How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
     Were't not that we stand up against them all,
     'Twere pregnant they should square between
     themselves;
     For they have entertained cause enough
     To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
     May cement their divisions and bind up
     The petty difference, we yet not know.
     Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
     Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
     Come, Menas.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS. ****
     Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
LEPIDUS
     Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
     And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
     To soft and gentle speech.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I shall entreat him
     To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
     Let Antony look over Caesar's head
     And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
     Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
     I would not shave't to-day.
LEPIDUS
     'Tis not a time
     For private stomaching.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Every time
     Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
LEPIDUS
     But small to greater matters must give way.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Not if the small come first.
LEPIDUS
     Your speech is passion:
     But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
     The noble Antony.
     Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     And yonder, Caesar.
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
MARK ANTONY
     If we compose well here, to Parthia:
     Hark, Ventidius.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I do not know,
     Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.
LEPIDUS
     Noble friends,
     That which combined us was most great, and let not
     A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
     May it be gently heard: when we debate
     Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
     Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
     The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
     Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
     Nor curstness grow to the matter.
MARK ANTONY
     'Tis spoken well.
     Were we before our armies, and to fight.
     I should do thus.
     Flourish
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Welcome to Rome.
MARK ANTONY
     Thank you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Sit.
MARK ANTONY
     Sit, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Nay, then.
MARK ANTONY
     I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
     Or being, concern you not.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I must be laugh'd at,
     If, or for nothing or a little, I
     Should say myself offended, and with you
     Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should
     Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
     It not concern'd me.
MARK ANTONY
     My being in Egypt, Caesar,
     What was't to you?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     No more than my residing here at Rome
     Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there
     Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
     Might be my question.
MARK ANTONY
     How intend you, practised?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
     By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
     Made wars upon me; and their contestation
     Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
MARK ANTONY
     You do mistake your business; my brother never
     Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
     And have my learning from some true reports,
     That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
     Discredit my authority with yours;
     And make the wars alike against my stomach,
     Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
     Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
     As matter whole you have not to make it with,
     It must not be with this.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You praise yourself
     By laying defects of judgment to me; but
     You patch'd up your excuses.
MARK ANTONY
     Not so, not so;
     I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
     Very necessity of this thought, that I,
     Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
     Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
     Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
     I would you had her spirit in such another:
     The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
     You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
     to wars with the women!
MARK ANTONY
     So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
     Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
     Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
     Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
     But say, I could not help it.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I wrote to you
     When rioting in Alexandria; you
     Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
     Did gibe my missive out of audience.
MARK ANTONY
     Sir,
     He fell upon me ere admitted: then
     Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
     Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
     I told him of myself; which was as much
     As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
     Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
     Out of our question wipe him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You have broken
     The article of your oath; which you shall never
     Have tongue to charge me with.
LEPIDUS
     Soft, Caesar!
MARK ANTONY
     No,
     Lepidus, let him speak:
     The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
     Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
     The article of my oath.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
     The which you both denied.
MARK ANTONY
     Neglected, rather;
     And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
     From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
     I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
     Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
     Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
     To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
     For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
     So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
     To stoop in such a case.
LEPIDUS
     'Tis noble spoken.
MECAENAS
     If it might please you, to enforce no further
     The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
     Were to remember that the present need
     Speaks to atone you.
LEPIDUS
     Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
     instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
     Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
     wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
MARK ANTONY
     Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
MARK ANTONY
     You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Go to, then; your considerate stone.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I do not much dislike the matter, but
     The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
     We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
     So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
     What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
     O' the world I would pursue it.
AGRIPPA
     Give me leave, Caesar,--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Speak, Agrippa.
AGRIPPA
     Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
     Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
     Is now a widower.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Say not so, Agrippa:
     If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
     Were well deserved of rashness.
MARK ANTONY
     I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
     Agrippa further speak.
AGRIPPA
     To hold you in perpetual amity,
     To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
     With an unslipping knot, take Antony
     Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
     No worse a husband than the best of men;
     Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
     That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
     All little jealousies, which now seem great,
     And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
     Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
     Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
     Would, each to other and all loves to both,
     Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
     For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
     By duty ruminated.
MARK ANTONY
     Will Caesar speak?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
     With what is spoke already.
MARK ANTONY
     What power is in Agrippa,
     If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
     To make this good?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     The power of Caesar, and
     His power unto Octavia.
MARK ANTONY
     May I never
     To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
     Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
     Further this act of grace: and from this hour
     The heart of brothers govern in our loves
     And sway our great designs!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     There is my hand.
     A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
     Did ever love so dearly: let her live
     To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
     Fly off our loves again!
LEPIDUS
     Happily, amen!
MARK ANTONY
     I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
     For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
     Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
     Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
     At heel of that, defy him.
LEPIDUS
     Time calls upon's:
     Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
     Or else he seeks out us.
MARK ANTONY
     Where lies he?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     About the mount Misenum.
MARK ANTONY
     What is his strength by land?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Great and increasing: but by sea
     He is an absolute master.
MARK ANTONY
     So is the fame.
     Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
     Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
     The business we have talk'd of.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     With most gladness:
     And do invite you to my sister's view,
     Whither straight I'll lead you.
MARK ANTONY
     Let us, Lepidus,
     Not lack your company.
LEPIDUS
     Noble Antony,
     Not sickness should detain me.
     Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS
MECAENAS
     Welcome from Egypt, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
     honourable friend, Agrippa!
AGRIPPA
     Good Enobarbus!
MECAENAS
     We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
     digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
     made the night light with drinking.
MECAENAS
     Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
     but twelve persons there; is this true?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
     monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
MECAENAS
     She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
     her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
     his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
AGRIPPA
     There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
     well for her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I will tell you.
     The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
     Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
     Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
     The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
     Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
     The water which they beat to follow faster,
     As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
     It beggar'd all description: she did lie
     In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
     O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
     The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
     Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
     With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
     To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
     And what they undid did.
AGRIPPA
     O, rare for Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
     So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
     And made their bends adornings: at the helm
     A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
     Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
     That yarely frame the office. From the barge
     A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
     Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
     Her people out upon her; and Antony,
     Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
     Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
     Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
     And made a gap in nature.
AGRIPPA
     Rare Egyptian!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
     Invited her to supper: she replied,
     It should be better he became her guest;
     Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
     Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
     Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
     And for his ordinary pays his heart
     For what his eyes eat only.
AGRIPPA
     Royal wench!
     She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
     He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I saw her once
     Hop forty paces through the public street;
     And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
     That she did make defect perfection,
     And, breathless, power breathe forth.
MECAENAS
     Now Antony must leave her utterly.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Never; he will not:
     Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
     Her infinite variety: other women cloy
     The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
     Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
     Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
     Bless her when she is riggish.
MECAENAS
     If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
     The heart of Antony, Octavia is
     A blessed lottery to him.
AGRIPPA
     Let us go.
     Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
     Whilst you abide here.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Humbly, sir, I thank you.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and
     Attendants
MARK ANTONY
     The world and my great office will sometimes
     Divide me from your bosom.
OCTAVIA
     All which time
     Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
     To them for you.
MARK ANTONY
     Good night, sir. My Octavia,
     Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
     I have not kept my square; but that to come
     Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
     Good night, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Good night.
     Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
     Enter Soothsayer
MARK ANTONY
     Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?
Soothsayer
     Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
MARK ANTONY
     If you can, your reason?
Soothsayer
     I see it in
     My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
     Hie you to Egypt again.
MARK ANTONY
     Say to me,
     Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
Soothsayer
     Caesar's.
     Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
     Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
     Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
     Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
     Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
     Make space enough between you.
MARK ANTONY
     Speak this no more.
Soothsayer
     To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
     If thou dost play with him at any game,
     Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,
     He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
     When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
     Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
     But, he away, 'tis noble.
MARK ANTONY
     Get thee gone:
     Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
     Exit Soothsayer
     He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
     He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
     And in our sports my better cunning faints
     Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
     His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
     When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
     Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
     And though I make this marriage for my peace,
     I' the east my pleasure lies.
     Enter VENTIDIUS
     O, come, Ventidius,
     You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
     Follow me, and receive't.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. The same. A street. ****
     Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
LEPIDUS
     Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
     Your generals after.
AGRIPPA
     Sir, Mark Antony
     Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
LEPIDUS
     Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
     Which will become you both, farewell.
MECAENAS
     We shall,
     As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
     Before you, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS
     Your way is shorter;
     My purposes do draw me much about:
     You'll win two days upon me.
MECAENAS AGRIPPA
     Sir, good success!
LEPIDUS
     Farewell.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA
     Give me some music; music, moody food
     Of us that trade in love.
Attendants
     The music, ho!
     Enter MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA
     Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.
CHARMIAN
     My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
CLEOPATRA
     As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
     As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
MARDIAN
     As well as I can, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     And when good will is show'd, though't come
     too short,
     The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
     Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
     My music playing far off, I will betray
     Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
     Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
     I'll think them every one an Antony,
     And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'
CHARMIAN
     'Twas merry when
     You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
     Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
     With fervency drew up.
CLEOPATRA
     That time,--O times!--
     I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
     I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
     Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
     Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
     I wore his sword Philippan.
     Enter a Messenger
     O, from Italy
     Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
     That long time have been barren.
Messenger
     Madam, madam,--
CLEOPATRA
     Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
     Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
     If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
     My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
     Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
Messenger
     First, madam, he is well.
CLEOPATRA
     Why, there's more gold.
     But, sirrah, mark, we use
     To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
     The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
     Down thy ill-uttering throat.
Messenger
     Good madam, hear me.
CLEOPATRA
     Well, go to, I will;
     But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
     Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
     To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
     Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
     Not like a formal man.
Messenger
     Will't please you hear me?
CLEOPATRA
     I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
     Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
     Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
     I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
     Rich pearls upon thee.
Messenger
     Madam, he's well.
CLEOPATRA
     Well said.
Messenger
     And friends with Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
     Thou'rt an honest man.
Messenger
     Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
CLEOPATRA
     Make thee a fortune from me.
Messenger
     But yet, madam,--
CLEOPATRA
     I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
     The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
     'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
     Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
     Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
     The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
     In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
Messenger
     Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
     He's bound unto Octavia.
CLEOPATRA
     For what good turn?
Messenger
     For the best turn i' the bed.
CLEOPATRA
     I am pale, Charmian.
Messenger
     Madam, he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA
     The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
     Strikes him down
Messenger
     Good madam, patience.
CLEOPATRA
     What say you? Hence,
     Strikes him again
     Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
     Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
     She hales him up and down
     Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
     Smarting in lingering pickle.
Messenger
     Gracious madam,
     I that do bring the news made not the match.
CLEOPATRA
     Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
     And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
     Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
     And I will boot thee with what gift beside
     Thy modesty can beg.
Messenger
     He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
     Draws a knife
Messenger
     Nay, then I'll run.
     What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
     Exit
CHARMIAN
     Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
     The man is innocent.
CLEOPATRA
     Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
     Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
     Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
     Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
CHARMIAN
     He is afeard to come.
CLEOPATRA
     I will not hurt him.
     Exit CHARMIAN
     These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
     A meaner than myself; since I myself
     Have given myself the cause.
     Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger
     Come hither, sir.
     Though it be honest, it is never good
     To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
     An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
     Themselves when they be felt.
Messenger
     I have done my duty.
CLEOPATRA
     Is he married?
     I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
     If thou again say 'Yes.'
Messenger
     He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
Messenger
     Should I lie, madam?
CLEOPATRA
     O, I would thou didst,
     So half my Egypt were submerged and made
     A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
     Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
     Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
Messenger
     I crave your highness' pardon.
CLEOPATRA
     He is married?
Messenger
     Take no offence that I would not offend you:
     To punish me for what you make me do.
     Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA
     O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
     That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
     The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
     Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
     And be undone by 'em!
     Exit Messenger
CHARMIAN
     Good your highness, patience.
CLEOPATRA
     In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
CHARMIAN
     Many times, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     I am paid for't now.
     Lead me from hence:
     I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
     Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
     Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
     Her inclination, let him not leave out
     The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
     Exit ALEXAS
     Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
     Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
     The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
     To MARDIAN
     Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
     But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. Near Misenum. ****
     Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet:
     at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS
     ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching
POMPEY
     Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
     And we shall talk before we fight.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Most meet
     That first we come to words; and therefore have we
     Our written purposes before us sent;
     Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
     If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
     And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
     That else must perish here.
POMPEY
     To you all three,
     The senators alone of this great world,
     Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
     Wherefore my father should revengers want,
     Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
     Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
     There saw you labouring for him. What was't
     That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
     Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
     With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
     To drench the Capitol; but that they would
     Have one man but a man? And that is it
     Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
     The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
     To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
     Cast on my noble father.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Take your time.
MARK ANTONY
     Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
     We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
     How much we do o'er-count thee.
POMPEY
     At land, indeed,
     Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
     But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
     Remain in't as thou mayst.
LEPIDUS
     Be pleased to tell us--
     For this is from the present--how you take
     The offers we have sent you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     There's the point.
MARK ANTONY
     Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
     What it is worth embraced.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     And what may follow,
     To try a larger fortune.
POMPEY
     You have made me offer
     Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
     Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
     Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
     To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
     Our targes undinted.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS
     That's our offer.
POMPEY
     Know, then,
     I came before you here a man prepared
     To take this offer: but Mark Antony
     Put me to some impatience: though I lose
     The praise of it by telling, you must know,
     When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
     Your mother came to Sicily and did find
     Her welcome friendly.
MARK ANTONY
     I have heard it, Pompey;
     And am well studied for a liberal thanks
     Which I do owe you.
POMPEY
     Let me have your hand:
     I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
MARK ANTONY
     The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
     That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
     For I have gain'd by 't.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Since I saw you last,
     There is a change upon you.
POMPEY
     Well, I know not
     What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
     But in my bosom shall she never come,
     To make my heart her vassal.
LEPIDUS
     Well met here.
POMPEY
     I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
     I crave our composition may be written,
     And seal'd between us.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     That's the next to do.
POMPEY
     We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
     Draw lots who shall begin.
MARK ANTONY
     That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY
     No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
     Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
     Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
     Grew fat with feasting there.
MARK ANTONY
     You have heard much.
POMPEY
     I have fair meanings, sir.
MARK ANTONY
     And fair words to them.
POMPEY
     Then so much have I heard:
     And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     No more of that: he did so.
POMPEY
     What, I pray you?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY
     I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Well;
     And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
     Four feasts are toward.
POMPEY
     Let me shake thy hand;
     I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
     When I have envied thy behavior.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Sir,
     I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
     When you have well deserved ten times as much
     As I have said you did.
POMPEY
     Enjoy thy plainness,
     It nothing ill becomes thee.
     Aboard my galley I invite you all:
     Will you lead, lords?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS
     Show us the way, sir.
POMPEY
     Come.
     Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
MENAS
     [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
     made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     At sea, I think.
MENAS
     We have, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     You have done well by water.
MENAS
     And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
     cannot be denied what I have done by land.
MENAS
     Nor what I have done by water.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Yes, something you can deny for your own
     safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
MENAS
     And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     There I deny my land service. But give me your
     hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
     might take two thieves kissing.
MENAS
     All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS
     No slander; they steal hearts.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS
     For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
     Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
MENAS
     You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
     here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
MENAS
     True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS
     Pray ye, sir?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     'Tis true.
MENAS
     Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
     not prophesy so.
MENAS
     I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
     marriage than the love of the parties.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
     seems to tie their friendship together will be the
     very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
     holy, cold, and still conversation.
MENAS
     Who would not have his wife so?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
     He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
     sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
     I said before, that which is the strength of their
     amity shall prove the immediate author of their
     variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
     he married but his occasion here.
MENAS
     And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
     I have a health for you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
MENAS
     Come, let's away.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum. ****
     Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
First Servant
     Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
     ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
     will blow them down.
Second Servant
     Lepidus is high-coloured.
First Servant
     They have made him drink alms-drink.
Second Servant
     As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
     cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
     entreaty, and himself to the drink.
First Servant
     But it raises the greater war between him and
     his discretion.
Second Servant
     Why, this is to have a name in great men's
     fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
     me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
First Servant
     To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
     to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
     which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
     A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
     POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other
     captains
MARK ANTONY
     [To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
     the flow o' the Nile
     By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
     By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
     Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
     The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
     Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
     And shortly comes to harvest.
LEPIDUS
     You've strange serpents there.
MARK ANTONY
     Ay, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS
     Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
     operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
MARK ANTONY
     They are so.
POMPEY
     Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
LEPIDUS
     I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
LEPIDUS
     Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
     pyramises are very goodly things; without
     contradiction, I have heard that.
MENAS
     [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
POMPEY
     [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
     what is't?
MENAS
     [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
     thee, captain,
     And hear me speak a word.
POMPEY
     [Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
     This wine for Lepidus!
LEPIDUS
     What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
MARK ANTONY
     It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
     as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
     and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
     which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
     it, it transmigrates.
LEPIDUS
     What colour is it of?
MARK ANTONY
     Of it own colour too.
LEPIDUS
     'Tis a strange serpent.
MARK ANTONY
     'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Will this description satisfy him?
MARK ANTONY
     With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
     very epicure.
POMPEY
     [Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
     that? away!
     Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
MENAS
     [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
     wilt hear me,
     Rise from thy stool.
POMPEY
     [Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
     The matter?
     Rises, and walks aside
MENAS
     I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
POMPEY
     Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
     Be jolly, lords.
MARK ANTONY
     These quick-sands, Lepidus,
     Keep off them, for you sink.
MENAS
     Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
POMPEY
     What say'st thou?
MENAS
     Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
POMPEY
     How should that be?
MENAS
     But entertain it,
     And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
     Will give thee all the world.
POMPEY
     Hast thou drunk well?
MENAS
     Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
     Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
     Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
     Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
POMPEY
     Show me which way.
MENAS
     These three world-sharers, these competitors,
     Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
     And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
     All there is thine.
POMPEY
     Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
     And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
     In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
     'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
     Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
     Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
     I should have found it afterwards well done;
     But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
MENAS
     [Aside] For this,
     I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
     Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
     Shall never find it more.
POMPEY
     This health to Lepidus!
MARK ANTONY
     Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Here's to thee, Menas!
MENAS
     Enobarbus, welcome!
POMPEY
     Fill till the cup be hid.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     There's a strong fellow, Menas.
     Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
MENAS
     Why?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
     not?
MENAS
     The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
     That it might go on wheels!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Drink thou; increase the reels.
MENAS
     Come.
POMPEY
     This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
MARK ANTONY
     It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
     Here is to Caesar!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I could well forbear't.
     It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
     And it grows fouler.
MARK ANTONY
     Be a child o' the time.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Possess it, I'll make answer:
     But I had rather fast from all four days
     Than drink so much in one.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Ha, my brave emperor!
     To MARK ANTONY
     Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
     And celebrate our drink?
POMPEY
     Let's ha't, good soldier.
MARK ANTONY
     Come, let's all take hands,
     Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
     In soft and delicate Lethe.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     All take hands.
     Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
     The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
     The holding every man shall bear as loud
     As his strong sides can volley.
     Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
     THE SONG.
     Come, thou monarch of the vine,
     Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
     In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
     With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
     Cup us, till the world go round,
     Cup us, till the world go round!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
     Let me request you off: our graver business
     Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
     You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
     Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
     Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
     Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
     Good Antony, your hand.
POMPEY
     I'll try you on the shore.
MARK ANTONY
     And shall, sir; give's your hand.
POMPEY
     O Antony,
     You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
     Come, down into the boat.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Take heed you fall not.
     Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
     Menas, I'll not on shore.
MENAS
     No, to my cabin.
     These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
     Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
     To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
     Sound a flourish, with drums
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Ho! says a' There's my cap.
MENAS
     Ho! Noble captain, come.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. A plain in Syria. ****
     Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans,
     Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him
VENTIDIUS
     Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
     Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
     Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
     Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
     Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
SILIUS
     Noble Ventidius,
     Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
     The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
     Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
     The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
     Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
     Put garlands on thy head.
VENTIDIUS
     O Silius, Silius,
     I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
     May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
     Better to leave undone, than by our deed
     Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
     Caesar and Antony have ever won
     More in their officer than person: Sossius,
     One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
     For quick accumulation of renown,
     Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
     Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
     Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
     The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
     Than gain which darkens him.
     I could do more to do Antonius good,
     But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
     Should my performance perish.
SILIUS
     Thou hast, Ventidius,
     that
     Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
     Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
VENTIDIUS
     I'll humbly signify what in his name,
     That magical word of war, we have effected;
     How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
     The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
     We have jaded out o' the field.
SILIUS
     Where is he now?
VENTIDIUS
     He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
     The weight we must convey with's will permit,
     We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. ****
     Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another
AGRIPPA
     What, are the brothers parted?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
     The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
     To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
     Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
     With the green sickness.
AGRIPPA
     'Tis a noble Lepidus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
AGRIPPA
     Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
AGRIPPA
     What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
AGRIPPA
     O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
AGRIPPA
     Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
     Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
     poets, cannot
     Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
     His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
     Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
AGRIPPA
     Both he loves.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     They are his shards, and he their beetle.
     Trumpets within
     So;
     This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
AGRIPPA
     Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
MARK ANTONY
     No further, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You take from me a great part of myself;
     Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
     As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
     Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
     Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
     Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
     To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
     The fortress of it; for better might we
     Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
     This be not cherish'd.
MARK ANTONY
     Make me not offended
     In your distrust.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I have said.
MARK ANTONY
     You shall not find,
     Though you be therein curious, the least cause
     For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
     And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
     We will here part.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
     The elements be kind to thee, and make
     Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
OCTAVIA
     My noble brother!
MARK ANTONY
     The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
     And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
OCTAVIA
     Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     What, Octavia?
OCTAVIA
     I'll tell you in your ear.
MARK ANTONY
     Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
     Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
     down-feather,
     That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
     And neither way inclines.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
AGRIPPA
     [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
     were he a horse;
     So is he, being a man.
AGRIPPA
     [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
     When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
     He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
     When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
     troubled with a rheum;
     What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
     Believe't, till I wept too.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     No, sweet Octavia,
     You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
     Out-go my thinking on you.
MARK ANTONY
     Come, sir, come;
     I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
     Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
     And give you to the gods.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Adieu; be happy!
LEPIDUS
     Let all the number of the stars give light
     To thy fair way!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Farewell, fa rewell!
     Kisses OCTAVIA
MARK ANTONY
     Farewell!
     Trumpets sound. Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA
     Where is the fellow?
ALEXAS
     Half afeard to come.
CLEOPATRA
     Go to, go to.
     Enter the Messenger as before
     Come hither, sir.
ALEXAS
     Good majesty,
     Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
     But when you are well pleased.
CLEOPATRA
     That Herod's head
     I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
     Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
Messenger
     Most gracious majesty,--
CLEOPATRA
     Didst thou behold Octavia?
Messenger
     Ay, dread queen.
CLEOPATRA
     Where?
Messenger
     Madam, in Rome;
     I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
     Between her brother and Mark Antony.
CLEOPATRA
     Is she as tall as me?
Messenger
     She is not, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
Messenger
     Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.
CLEOPATRA
     That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
CHARMIAN
     Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
CLEOPATRA
     I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
     What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
     If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
Messenger
     She creeps:
     Her motion and her station are as one;
     She shows a body rather than a life,
     A statue than a breather.
CLEOPATRA
     Is this certain?
Messenger
     Or I have no observance.
CHARMIAN
     Three in Egypt
     Cannot make better note.
CLEOPATRA
     He's very knowing;
     I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
     The fellow has good judgment.
CHARMIAN
     Excellent.
CLEOPATRA
     Guess at her years, I prithee.
Messenger
     Madam,
     She was a widow,--
CLEOPATRA
     Widow! Charmian, hark.
Messenger
     And I do think she's thirty.
CLEOPATRA
     Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
Messenger
     Round even to faultiness.
CLEOPATRA
     For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
     Her hair, what colour?
Messenger
     Brown, madam: and her forehead
     As low as she would wish it.
CLEOPATRA
     There's gold for thee.
     Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
     I will employ thee back again; I find thee
     Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
     Our letters are prepared.
     Exit Messenger
CHARMIAN
     A proper man.
CLEOPATRA
     Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
     That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
     This creature's no such thing.
CHARMIAN
     Nothing, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
CHARMIAN
     Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
     And serving you so long!
CLEOPATRA
     I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
     But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
     Where I will write. All may be well enough.
CHARMIAN
     I warrant you, madam.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA
MARK ANTONY
     Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
     That were excusable, that, and thousands more
     Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
     New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
     To public ear:
     Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
     But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
     He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
     When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
     Or did it from his teeth.
OCTAVIA
     O my good lord,
     Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
     Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
     If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
     Praying for both parts:
     The good gods me presently,
     When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
     Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
     'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
     Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
     'Twixt these extremes at all.
MARK ANTONY
     Gentle Octavia,
     Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
     Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
     I lose myself: better I were not yours
     Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
     Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
     I'll raise the preparation of a war
     Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
     So your desires are yours.
OCTAVIA
     Thanks to my lord.
     The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
     Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
     As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
     Should solder up the rift.
MARK ANTONY
     When it appears to you where this begins,
     Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
     Can never be so equal, that your love
     Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
     Choose your own company, and command what cost
     Your heart has mind to.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. The same. Another room. ****
     Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     How now, friend Eros!
EROS
     There's strange news come, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     What, man?
EROS
     Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     This is old: what is the success?
EROS
     Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
     Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
     him partake in the glory of the action: and not
     resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
     wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
     the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
     And throw between them all the food thou hast,
     They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
EROS
     He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
     The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
     And threats the throat of that his officer
     That murder'd Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Our great navy's rigg'd.
EROS
     For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
     My lord desires you presently: my news
     I might have told hereafter.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     'Twill be naught:
     But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
EROS
     Come, sir.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
     In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
     I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
     Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
     Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
     Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
     And all the unlawful issue that their lust
     Since then hath made between them. Unto her
     He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
     Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
     Absolute queen.
MECAENAS
     This in the public eye?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
     His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
     Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
     He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
     Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
     In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
     That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
     As 'tis reported, so.
MECAENAS
     Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
AGRIPPA
     Who, queasy with his insolence
     Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     The people know it; and have now received
     His accusations.
AGRIPPA
     Who does he accuse?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
     Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
     His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
     Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
     That Lepidus of the triumvirate
     Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
     All his revenue.
AGRIPPA
     Sir, this should be answer'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
     I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
     That he his high authority abused,
     And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
     I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
     And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
     Demand the like.
MECAENAS
     He'll never yield to that.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
     Enter OCTAVIA with her train
OCTAVIA
     Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     That ever I should call thee castaway!
OCTAVIA
     You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
     Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
     Should have an army for an usher, and
     The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
     Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
     Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
     Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
     Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
     Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
     A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
     The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
     Is often left unloved; we should have met you
     By sea and land; supplying every stage
     With an augmented greeting.
OCTAVIA
     Good my lord,
     To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
     On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
     Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
     My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
     His pardon for return.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Which soon he granted,
     Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
OCTAVIA
     Do not say so, my lord.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     I have eyes upon him,
     And his affairs come to me on the wind.
     Where is he now?
OCTAVIA
     My lord, in Athens.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
     Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
     Up to a whore; who now are levying
     The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
     Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
     Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
     Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
     King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
     Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
     Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
     The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
     With a more larger list of sceptres.
OCTAVIA
     Ay me, most wretched,
     That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
     That do afflict each other!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Welcome hither:
     Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
     Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
     And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
     Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
     O'er your content these strong necessities;
     But let determined things to destiny
     Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
     Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
     Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
     To do you justice, make them ministers
     Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
     And ever welcome to us.
AGRIPPA
     Welcome, lady.
MECAENAS
     Welcome, dear madam.
     Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
     Only the adulterous Antony, most large
     In his abominations, turns you off;
     And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
     That noises it against us.
OCTAVIA
     Is it so, sir?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
     Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
CLEOPATRA
     I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     But why, why, why?
CLEOPATRA
     Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
     And say'st it is not fit.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Well, is it, is it?
CLEOPATRA
     If not denounced against us, why should not we
     Be there in person?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside] Well, I could reply:
     If we should serve with horse and mares together,
     The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
     A soldier and his horse.
CLEOPATRA
     What is't you say?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
     Take from his heart, take from his brain,
     from's time,
     What should not then be spared. He is already
     Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
     That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
     Manage this war.
CLEOPATRA
     Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
     That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
     And, as the president of my kingdom, will
     Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
     I will not stay behind.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Nay, I have done.
     Here comes the emperor.
     Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS
MARK ANTONY
     Is it not strange, Canidius,
     That from Tarentum and Brundusium
     He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
     And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?
CLEOPATRA
     Celerity is never more admired
     Than by the negligent.
MARK ANTONY
     A good rebuke,
     Which might have well becomed the best of men,
     To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
     Will fight with him by sea.
CLEOPATRA
     By sea! what else?
CANIDIUS
     Why will my lord do so?
MARK ANTONY
     For that he dares us to't.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
CANIDIUS
     Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
     Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
     Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
     And so should you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Your ships are not well mann'd;
     Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
     Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
     Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
     Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
     Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
     Being prepared for land.
MARK ANTONY
     By sea, by sea.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
     The absolute soldiership you have by land;
     Distract your army, which doth most consist
     Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
     Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
     The way which promises assurance; and
     Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
     From firm security.
MARK ANTONY
     I'll fight at sea.
CLEOPATRA
     I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
MARK ANTONY
     Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
     And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
     Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
     We then can do't at land.
     Enter a Messenger
     Thy business?
Messenger
     The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
     Caesar has taken Toryne.
MARK ANTONY
     Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
     Strange that power should be. Canidius,
     Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
     And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
     Away, my Thetis!
     Enter a Soldier
     How now, worthy soldier?
Soldier
     O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
     Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
     This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
     And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
     Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
     And fighting foot to foot.
MARK ANTONY
     Well, well: away!
     Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Soldier
     By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
CANIDIUS
     Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
     Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
     And we are women's men.
Soldier
     You keep by land
     The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
CANIDIUS
     Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
     Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
     But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
     Carries beyond belief.
Soldier
     While he was yet in Rome,
     His power went out in such distractions as
     Beguiled all spies.
CANIDIUS
     Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
Soldier
     They say, one Taurus.
CANIDIUS
     Well I know the man.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     The emperor calls Canidius.
CANIDIUS
     With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
     Each minute, some.

**** SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Taurus!
TAURUS
     My lord?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,
     Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
     The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
     Upon this jump.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IX. Another part of the plain. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
MARK ANTONY
     Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,
     In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
     We may the number of the ships behold,
     And so proceed accordingly.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE X. Another part of the plain. ****
     CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and
     TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their
     going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight
     Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
     The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
     With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
     To see't mine eyes are blasted.
     Enter SCARUS
SCARUS
     Gods and goddesses,
     All the whole synod of them!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     What's thy passion!
SCARUS
     The greater cantle of the world is lost
     With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
     Kingdoms and provinces.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     How appears the fight?
SCARUS
     On our side like the token'd pestilence,
     Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
     Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
     When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
     Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
     The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
     Hoists sails and flies.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     That I beheld:
     Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
     Endure a further view.
SCARUS
     She once being loof'd,
     The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
     Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
     Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
     I never saw an action of such shame;
     Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
     Did violate so itself.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Alack, alack!
     Enter CANIDIUS
CANIDIUS
     Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
     And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
     Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
     O, he has given example for our flight,
     Most grossly, by his own!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Ay, are you thereabouts?
     Why, then, good night indeed.
CANIDIUS
     Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
SCARUS
     'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
     What further comes.
CANIDIUS
     To Caesar will I render
     My legions and my horse: six kings already
     Show me the way of yielding.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I'll yet follow
     The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
     Sits in the wind against me.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants
MARK ANTONY
     Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
     It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
     I am so lated in the world, that I
     Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
     Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
     And make your peace with Caesar.
All
     Fly! not we.
MARK ANTONY
     I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
     To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
     I have myself resolved upon a course
     Which has no need of you; be gone:
     My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
     I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
     My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
     Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
     For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
     Have letters from me to some friends that will
     Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
     Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
     Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
     Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
     I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
     Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
     Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
     Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.
     Sits down
     Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following
EROS
     Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.
IRAS
     Do, most dear queen.
CHARMIAN
     Do! why: what else?
CLEOPATRA
     Let me sit down. O Juno!
MARK ANTONY
     No, no, no, no, no.
EROS
     See you here, sir?
MARK ANTONY
     O fie, fie, fie!
CHARMIAN
     Madam!
IRAS
     Madam, O good empress!
EROS
     Sir, sir,--
MARK ANTONY
     Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
     His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
     The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
     That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
     Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
     In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.
CLEOPATRA
     Ah, stand by.
EROS
     The queen, my lord, the queen.
IRAS
     Go to him, madam, speak to him:
     He is unqualitied with very shame.
CLEOPATRA
     Well then, sustain him: O!
EROS
     Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
     Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
     Your comfort makes the rescue.
MARK ANTONY
     I have offended reputation,
     A most unnoble swerving.
EROS
     Sir, the queen.
MARK ANTONY
     O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
     How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
     By looking back what I have left behind
     'Stroy'd in dishonour.
CLEOPATRA
     O my lord, my lord,
     Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
     You would have follow'd.
MARK ANTONY
     Egypt, thou knew'st too well
     My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
     And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
     Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
     Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
     Command me.
CLEOPATRA
     O, my pardon!
MARK ANTONY
     Now I must
     To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
     And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
     With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
     Making and marring fortunes. You did know
     How much you were my conqueror; and that
     My sword, made weak by my affection, would
     Obey it on all cause.
CLEOPATRA
     Pardon, pardon!
MARK ANTONY
     Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
     All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
     Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
     Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
     Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
     We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Let him appear that's come from Antony.
     Know you him?
DOLABELLA
     Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
     An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
     He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
     Which had superfluous kings for messengers
     Not many moons gone by.
     Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Approach, and speak.
EUPHRONIUS
     Such as I am, I come from Antony:
     I was of late as petty to his ends
     As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
     To his grand sea.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Be't so: declare thine office.
EUPHRONIUS
     Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
     Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
     He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
     To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
     A private man in Athens: this for him.
     Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
     Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
     The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
     Now hazarded to thy grace.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     For Antony,
     I have no ears to his request. The queen
     Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
     From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
     Or take his life there: this if she perform,
     She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
EUPHRONIUS
     Fortune pursue thee!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Bring him through the bands.
     Exit EUPHRONIUS
     To THYREUS
     From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
     And in our name, what she requires; add more,
     From thine invention, offers: women are not
     In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
     The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
     Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
     Will answer as a law.
THYREUS
     Caesar, I go.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
     And what thou think'st his very action speaks
     In every power that moves.
THYREUS
     Caesar, I shall.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
CLEOPATRA
     What shall we do, Enobarbus?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Think, and die.
CLEOPATRA
     Is Antony or we in fault for this?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Antony only, that would make his will
     Lord of his reason. What though you fled
     From that great face of war, whose several ranges
     Frighted each other? why should he follow?
     The itch of his affection should not then
     Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
     When half to half the world opposed, he being
     The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
     Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
     And leave his navy gazing.
CLEOPATRA
     Prithee, peace.
     Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador
MARK ANTONY
     Is that his answer?
EUPHRONIUS
     Ay, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
     The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
     Will yield us up.
EUPHRONIUS
     He says so.
MARK ANTONY
     Let her know't.
     To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
     And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
     With principalities.
CLEOPATRA
     That head, my lord?
MARK ANTONY
     To him again: tell him he wears the rose
     Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
     Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
     May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
     Under the service of a child as soon
     As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
     To lay his gay comparisons apart,
     And answer me declined, sword against sword,
     Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
     Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
     Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
     Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
     A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
     Do draw the inward quality after them,
     To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
     Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
     Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
     His judgment too.
     Enter an Attendant
Attendant
     A messenger from CAESAR.
CLEOPATRA
     What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
     Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
     That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
     Exit Attendant
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
     The loyalty well held to fools does make
     Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
     To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
     Does conquer him that did his master conquer
     And earns a place i' the story.
     Enter THYREUS
CLEOPATRA
     Caesar's will?
THYREUS
     Hear it apart.
CLEOPATRA
     None but friends: say boldly.
THYREUS
     So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
     Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
     Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
     Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.
THYREUS
     So.
     Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
     Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
     Further than he is Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
     Go on: right royal.
THYREUS
     He knows that you embrace not Antony
     As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
CLEOPATRA
     O!
THYREUS
     The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
     Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
     Not as deserved.
CLEOPATRA
     He is a god, and knows
     What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
     But conquer'd merely.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside] To be sure of that,
     I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
     That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
     Thy dearest quit thee.
     Exit
THYREUS
     Shall I say to Caesar
     What you require of him? for he partly begs
     To be desired to give. It much would please him,
     That of his fortunes you should make a staff
     To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
     To hear from me you had left Antony,
     And put yourself under his shrowd,
     The universal landlord.
CLEOPATRA
     What's your name?
THYREUS
     My name is Thyreus.
CLEOPATRA
     Most kind messenger,
     Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
     I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
     To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
     Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
     The doom of Egypt.
THYREUS
     'Tis your noblest course.
     Wisdom and fortune combating together,
     If that the former dare but what it can,
     No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
     My duty on your hand.
CLEOPATRA
     Your Caesar's father oft,
     When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
     Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
     As it rain'd kisses.
     Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
MARK ANTONY
     Favours, by Jove that thunders!
     What art thou, fellow?
THYREUS
     One that but performs
     The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
     To have command obey'd.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside] You will be whipp'd.
MARK ANTONY
     Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
     and devils!
     Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
     Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
     And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
     Antony yet.
     Enter Attendants
     Take hence this Jack, and whip him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
     Than with an old one dying.
MARK ANTONY
     Moon and stars!
     Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
     That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
     So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
     Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
     Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
     And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.
THYREUS
     Mark Antony!
MARK ANTONY
     Tug him away: being whipp'd,
     Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
     Bear us an errand to him.

     You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
     Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
     Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
     And by a gem of women, to be abused
     By one that looks on feeders?
CLEOPATRA
     Good my lord,--
MARK ANTONY
     You have been a boggler ever:
     But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
     O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
     In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
     Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
     To our confusion.
CLEOPATRA
     O, is't come to this?
MARK ANTONY
     I found you as a morsel cold upon
     Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
     Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
     Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
     Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
     Though you can guess what temperance should be,
     You know not what it is.
CLEOPATRA
     Wherefore is this?
MARK ANTONY
     To let a fellow that will take rewards
     And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
     My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
     And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
     Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
     The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
     And to proclaim it civilly, were like
     A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
     For being yare about him.
     Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
     Is he whipp'd?
First Attendant
     Soundly, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
     Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
First Attendant
     He did ask favour.
MARK ANTONY
     If that thy father live, let him repent
     Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
     To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
     Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
     The white hand of a lady fever thee,
     Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
     Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
     He makes me angry with him; for he seems
     Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
     Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
     And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
     When my good stars, that were my former guides,
     Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
     Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
     My speech and what is done, tell him he has
     Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
     He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
     As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
     Hence with thy stripes, begone!
     Exit THYREUS
CLEOPATRA
     Have you done yet?
MARK ANTONY
     Alack, our terrene moon
     Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
     The fall of Antony!
CLEOPATRA
     I must stay his time.
MARK ANTONY
     To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
     With one that ties his points?
CLEOPATRA
     Not know me yet?
MARK ANTONY
     Cold-hearted toward me?
CLEOPATRA
     Ah, dear, if I be so,
     From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
     And poison it in the source; and the first stone
     Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
     Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
     Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
     Together with my brave Egyptians all,
     By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
     Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
     Have buried them for prey!
MARK ANTONY
     I am satisfied.
     Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
     I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
     Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
     Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
     Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
     If from the field I shall return once more
     To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
     I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
     There's hope in't yet.
CLEOPATRA
     That's my brave lord!
MARK ANTONY
     I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
     And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
     Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
     Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
     And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
     Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
     All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
     Let's mock the midnight bell.
CLEOPATRA
     It is my birth-day:
     I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
     Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
MARK ANTONY
     We will yet do well.
CLEOPATRA
     Call all his noble captains to my lord.
MARK ANTONY
     Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
     The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
     There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
     I'll make death love me; for I will contend
     Even with his pestilent scythe.
     Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
     Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
     The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
     A diminution in our captain's brain
     Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
     It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
     Some way to leave him.

**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS
     CAESAR reading a letter
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
     To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
     He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
     Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
     I have many other ways to die; meantime
     Laugh at his challenge.
MECAENAS
     Caesar must think,
     When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
     Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
     Make boot of his distraction: never anger
     Made good guard for itself.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Let our best heads
     Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
     We mean to fight: within our files there are,
     Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
     Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
     And feast the army; we have store to do't,
     And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS,
     ALEXAS, with others
MARK ANTONY
     He will not fight with me, Domitius.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     No.
MARK ANTONY
     Why should he not?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
     He is twenty men to one.
MARK ANTONY
     To-morrow, soldier,
     By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
     Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
     Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
MARK ANTONY
     Well said; come on.
     Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
     Be bounteous at our meal.
     Enter three or four Servitors
     Give me thy hand,
     Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
     Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
     And kings have been your fellows.
CLEOPATRA
     [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
     tricks which sorrow shoots
     Out of the mind.
MARK ANTONY
     And thou art honest too.
     I wish I could be made so many men,
     And all of you clapp'd up together in
     An Antony, that I might do you service
     So good as you have done.
All
     The gods forbid!
MARK ANTONY
     Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
     Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
     As when mine empire was your fellow too,
     And suffer'd my command.
CLEOPATRA
     [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.
MARK ANTONY
     Tend me to-night;
     May be it is the period of your duty:
     Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
     A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
     You'll serve another master. I look on you
     As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
     I turn you not away; but, like a master
     Married to your good service, stay till death:
     Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
     And the gods yield you for't!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     What mean you, sir,
     To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
     And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
     Transform us not to women.
MARK ANTONY
     Ho, ho, ho!
     Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
     Grace grow where those drops fall!
     My hearty friends,
     You take me in too dolorous a sense;
     For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
     To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
     I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
     Where rather I'll expect victorious life
     Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
     And drown consideration.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The same. Before the palace. ****
     Enter two Soldiers to their guard
First Soldier
     Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.
Second Soldier
     It will determine one way: fare you well.
     Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
First Soldier
     Nothing. What news?
Second Soldier
     Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
First Soldier
     Well, sir, good night.
     Enter two other Soldiers
Second Soldier
     Soldiers, have careful watch.
Third Soldier
     And you. Good night, good night.
     They place themselves in every corner of the stage
Fourth Soldier
     Here we: and if to-morrow
     Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
     Our landmen will stand up.
Third Soldier
     'Tis a brave army,
     And full of purpose.
     Music of the hautboys as under the stage
Fourth Soldier
     Peace! what noise?
First Soldier
     List, list!
Second Soldier
     Hark!
First Soldier
     Music i' the air.
Third Soldier
     Under the earth.
Fourth Soldier
     It signs well, does it not?
Third Soldier
     No.
First Soldier
     Peace, I say!
     What should this mean?
Second Soldier
     'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
     Now leaves him.
First Soldier
     Walk; let's see if other watchmen
     Do hear what we do?
     They advance to another post
Second Soldier
     How now, masters!
All
     [Speaking together] How now!
     How now! do you hear this?
First Soldier
     Ay; is't not strange?
Third Soldier
     Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
First Soldier
     Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
     Let's see how it will give off.
All
     Content. 'Tis strange.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending
MARK ANTONY
     Eros! mine armour, Eros!
CLEOPATRA
     Sleep a little.
MARK ANTONY
     No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
     Enter EROS with armour
     Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
     If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
     Because we brave her: come.
CLEOPATRA
     Nay, I'll help too.
     What's this for?
MARK ANTONY
     Ah, let be, let be! thou art
     The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.
CLEOPATRA
     Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
MARK ANTONY
     Well, well;
     We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
     Go put on thy defences.
EROS
     Briefly, sir.
CLEOPATRA
     Is not this buckled well?
MARK ANTONY
     Rarely, rarely:
     He that unbuckles this, till we do please
     To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
     Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
     More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
     That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
     The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
     A workman in't.
     Enter an armed Soldier
     Good morrow to thee; welcome:
     Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
     To business that we love we rise betime,
     And go to't with delight.
Soldier
     A thousand, sir,
     Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
     And at the port expect you.
     Shout. Trumpets flourish
     Enter Captains and Soldiers
Captain
     The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.
All
     Good morrow, general.
MARK ANTONY
     'Tis well blown, lads:
     This morning, like the spirit of a youth
     That means to be of note, begins betimes.
     So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
     Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
     This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
     Kisses her
     And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
     On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
     Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
     Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
     Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers
CHARMIAN
     Please you, retire to your chamber.
CLEOPATRA
     Lead me.
     He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
     Determine this great war in single fight!
     Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp. ****
     Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them
Soldier
     The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
MARK ANTONY
     Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
     To make me fight at land!
Soldier
     Hadst thou done so,
     The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
     That has this morning left thee, would have still
     Follow'd thy heels.
MARK ANTONY
     Who's gone this morning?
Soldier
     Who!
     One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
     He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
     Say 'I am none of thine.'
MARK ANTONY
     What say'st thou?
Soldier
     Sir,
     He is with Caesar.
EROS
     Sir, his chests and treasure
     He has not with him.
MARK ANTONY
     Is he gone?
Soldier
     Most certain.
MARK ANTONY
     Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
     Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
     I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
     Say that I wish he never find more cause
     To change a master. O, my fortunes have
     Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!

     and others
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
     Our will is Antony be took alive;
     Make it so known.
AGRIPPA
     Caesar, I shall.
     Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     The time of universal peace is near:
     Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
     Shall bear the olive freely.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     Antony
     Is come into the field.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Go charge Agrippa
     Plant those that have revolted in the van,
     That Antony may seem to spend his fury
     Upon himself.
     Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
     Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
     Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
     And leave his master Antony: for this pains
     Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
     That fell away have entertainment, but
     No honourable trust. I have done ill;
     Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
     That I will joy no more.
     Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's
Soldier
     Enobarbus, Antony
     Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
     His bounty overplus: the messenger
     Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
     Unloading of his mules.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I give it you.
Soldier
     Mock not, Enobarbus.
     I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
     Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
     Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
     Continues still a Jove.
     Exit
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     I am alone the villain of the earth,
     And feel I am so most. O Antony,
     Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
     My better service, when my turpitude
     Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
     If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
     Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
     I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
     Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
     My latter part of life.
     Exit
**** SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps. ****

AGRIPPA
     Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
     Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
     Exceeds what we expected.
     Exeunt
     Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded
SCARUS
     O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
     Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
     With clouts about their heads.
MARK ANTONY
     Thou bleed'st apace.
SCARUS
     I had a wound here that was like a T,
     But now 'tis made an H.
MARK ANTONY
     They do retire.
SCARUS
     We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
     Room for six scotches more.
     Enter EROS
EROS
     They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
     For a fair victory.
SCARUS
     Let us score their backs,
     And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
     'Tis sport to maul a runner.
MARK ANTONY
     I will reward thee
     Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
     For thy good valour. Come thee on.
SCARUS
     I'll halt after.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria. ****
     Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS, with others
MARK ANTONY
     We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
     And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
     Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
     That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
     For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
     Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
     Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
     Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
     Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
     Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
     The honour'd gashes whole.
     To SCARUS
     Give me thy hand
     Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
     To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
     Make her thanks bless thee.
     To CLEOPATRA
     O thou day o' the world,
     Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
     Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
     Ride on the pants triumphing!
CLEOPATRA
     Lord of lords!
     O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
     The world's great snare uncaught?
MARK ANTONY
     My nightingale,
     We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
     though grey
     Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
     A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
     Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
     Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
     Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
     As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
     Destroy'd in such a shape.
CLEOPATRA
     I'll give thee, friend,
     An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
MARK ANTONY
     He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
     Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
     Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
     Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
     Had our great palace the capacity
     To camp this host, we all would sup together,
     And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
     Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
     With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
     Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
     That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
     Applauding our approach.
     Exeunt

First Soldier
     If we be not relieved within this hour,
     We must return to the court of guard: the night
     Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
     By the second hour i' the morn.
Second Soldier
     This last day was
     A shrewd one to's.
     Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     O, bear me witness, night,--
Third Soldier
     What man is this?
Second Soldier
     Stand close, and list him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
     When men revolted shall upon record
     Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
     Before thy face repent!
First Soldier
     Enobarbus!
Third Soldier
     Peace!
     Hark further.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
     O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
     The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
     That life, a very rebel to my will,
     May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
     Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
     Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
     And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
     Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
     Forgive me in thine own particular;
     But let the world rank me in register
     A master-leaver and a fugitive:
     O Antony! O Antony!
     Dies
Second Soldier
     Let's speak To him.
First Soldier
     Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
     May concern Caesar.
Third Soldier
     Let's do so. But he sleeps.
First Soldier
     Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
     Was never yet for sleep.
Second Soldier
     Go we to him.
Third Soldier
     Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
Second Soldier
     Hear you, sir?
First Soldier
     The hand of death hath raught him.
     Drums afar off
     Hark! the drums
     Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
     To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
     Is fully out.
Third Soldier
     Come on, then;
     He may recover yet.

     Their preparation is to-day by sea;
     We please them not by land.
SCARUS
     For both, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
     I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
     We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
     Upon the hills adjoining to the city
     Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
     They have put forth the haven
     Where their appointment we may best discover,
     And look on their endeavour.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE XI. Another part of the same. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     But being charged, we will be still by land,
     Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
     Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
     And hold our best advantage.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE XII. Another part of the same. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS
MARK ANTONY
     Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
     does stand,
     I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
     Straight, how 'tis like to go.
     Exit
SCARUS
     Swallows have built
     In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
     Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
     And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
     Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
     His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
     Of what he has, and has not.
     Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight
     Re-enter MARK ANTONY
MARK ANTONY
     All is lost;
     This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
     My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
     They cast their caps up and carouse together
     Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
     'tis thou
     Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
     Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
     For when I am revenged upon my charm,
     I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.
     Exit SCARUS
     O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
     Fortune and Antony part here; even here
     Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
     That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
     Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
     On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
     That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
     O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
     Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
     Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
     Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
     Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
     What, Eros, Eros!
     Enter CLEOPATRA
     Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
CLEOPATRA
     Why is my lord enraged against his love?
MARK ANTONY
     Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
     And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
     And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
     Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
     Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
     For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
     Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
     With her prepared nails.
     Exit CLEOPATRA
     'Tis well thou'rt gone,
     If it be well to live; but better 'twere
     Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
     Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
     The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
     Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
     Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
     And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
     Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
     To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
     Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!
     Exit
**** SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA
     Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
     Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
     Was never so emboss'd.
CHARMIAN
     To the monument!
     There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
     The soul and body rive not more in parting
     Than greatness going off.
CLEOPATRA
     To the monument!
     Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
     Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
     And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
     And bring me how he takes my death.
     To the monument!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE XIV. The same. Another room. ****
     Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS
MARK ANTONY
     Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
EROS
     Ay, noble lord.
MARK ANTONY
     Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
     A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
     A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
     A forked mountain, or blue promontory
     With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
     And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
     these signs;
     They are black vesper's pageants.
EROS
     Ay, my lord,
MARK ANTONY
     That which is now a horse, even with a thought
     The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
     As water is in water.
EROS
     It does, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
     My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
     Even such a body: here I am Antony:
     Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
     I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
     Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
     Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
     A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
     Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
     Unto an enemy's triumph.
     Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
     Ourselves to end ourselves.
     Enter MARDIAN
     O! thy vile lady!
     She has robb'd me of my sword.
MARDIAN
     No, Antony;
     My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
     With thine entirely.
MARK ANTONY
     Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
     She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
MARDIAN
     Death of one person can be paid but once,
     And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
     Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
     Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
     Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
     The name of Antony; it was divided
     Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
     Thy name so buried in her.
MARK ANTONY
     Dead, then?
MARDIAN
     Dead.
MARK ANTONY
     Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
     And we must sleep.
     To MARDIAN
     That thou depart'st hence safe,
     Does pay thy labour richly; go.
     Exit MARDIAN
     Off, pluck off:
     The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
     The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
     Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
     Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
     No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
     You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
     Exit EROS
     I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
     Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
     All length is torture: since the torch is out,
     Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
     Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
     Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
     Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:
     Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
     And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
     Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
     And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!
     Re-enter EROS
EROS
     What would my lord?
MARK ANTONY
     Since Cleopatra died,
     I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
     Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
     Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
     With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
     The courage of a woman; less noble mind
     Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
     'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
     That, when the exigent should come, which now
     Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
     The inevitable prosecution of
     Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
     Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
     Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
     Put colour in thy cheek.
EROS
     The gods withhold me!
     Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
     Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?
MARK ANTONY
     Eros,
     Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
     Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
     His corrigible neck, his face subdued
     To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
     Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
     His baseness that ensued?
EROS
     I would not see't.
MARK ANTONY
     Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
     Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
     Most useful for thy country.
EROS
     O, sir, pardon me!
MARK ANTONY
     When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
     To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
     Or thy precedent services are all
     But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
EROS
     Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
     Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
MARK ANTONY
     Lo thee!
     Turning from him
EROS
     My sword is drawn.
MARK ANTONY
     Then let it do at once
     The thing why thou hast drawn it.
EROS
     My dear master,
     My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
     Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
MARK ANTONY
     'Tis said, man; and farewell.
EROS
     Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
MARK ANTONY
     Now, Eros.
EROS
     Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
     Of Antony's death.
     Kills himself
MARK ANTONY
     Thrice-nobler than myself!
     Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
     I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
     Have by their brave instruction got upon me
     A nobleness in record: but I will be
     A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
     As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
     Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
     Falling on his sword
     I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
     The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
     Enter DERCETAS and Guard
First Guard
     What's the noise?
MARK ANTONY
     I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
     Of what I have begun.
Second Guard
     The star is fall'n.
First Guard
     And time is at his period.
All
     Alas, and woe!
MARK ANTONY
     Let him that loves me strike me dead.
First Guard
     Not I.
Second Guard
     Nor I.
Third Guard
     Nor any one.
     Exeunt Guard
DERCETAS
     Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
     This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
     Shall enter me with him.
     Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES
     Where's Antony?
DERCETAS
     There, Diomed there.
DIOMEDES
     Lives he?
     Wilt thou not answer, man?
     Exit DERCETAS
MARK ANTONY
     Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
     Sufficing strokes for death.
DIOMEDES
     Most absolute lord,
     My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
MARK ANTONY
     When did she send thee?
DIOMEDES
     Now, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
     Where is she?
DIOMEDES
     Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
     Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
     Which never shall be found--you did suspect
     She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
     Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
     But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
     Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
     I dread, too late.
MARK ANTONY
     Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.
DIOMEDES
     What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
     Come, your lord calls!
     Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY
MARK ANTONY
     Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
     'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
First Guard
     Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
     All your true followers out.
All
     Most heavy day!
MARK ANTONY
     Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
     To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
     Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
     Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
     I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
     And have my thanks for all.
     Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY
**** SCENE XV. The same. A monument. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS
CLEOPATRA
     O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
CHARMIAN
     Be comforted, dear madam.
CLEOPATRA
     No, I will not:
     All strange and terrible events are welcome,
     But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
     Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
     As that which makes it.
     Enter, below, DIOMEDES
     How now! is he dead?
DIOMEDES
     His death's upon him, but not dead.
     Look out o' the other side your monument;
     His guard have brought him thither.
     Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard
CLEOPATRA
     O sun,
     Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
     darkling stand
     The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
     Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
     Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.
MARK ANTONY
     Peace!
     Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
     But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
CLEOPATRA
     So it should be, that none but Antony
     Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
MARK ANTONY
     I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
     I here importune death awhile, until
     Of many thousand kisses the poor last
     I lay up thy lips.
CLEOPATRA
     I dare not, dear,--
     Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
     Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
     Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
     Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
     serpents, have
     Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
     Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
     And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
     Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
     Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
     Assist, good friends.
MARK ANTONY
     O, quick, or I am gone.
CLEOPATRA
     Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
     Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
     That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
     The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
     And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
     Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;
     They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
     And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
     Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
     Thus would I wear them out.
All
     A heavy sight!
MARK ANTONY
     I am dying, Egypt, dying:
     Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
CLEOPATRA
     No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
     That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
     Provoked by my offence.
MARK ANTONY
     One word, sweet queen:
     Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
CLEOPATRA
     They do not go together.
MARK ANTONY
     Gentle, hear me:
     None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA
     My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
     None about Caesar.
MARK ANTONY
     The miserable change now at my end
     Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
     In feeding them with those my former fortunes
     Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
     The noblest; and do now not basely die,
     Not cowardly put off my helmet to
     My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
     Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
     I can no more.
CLEOPATRA
     Noblest of men, woo't die?
     Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
     In this dull world, which in thy absence is
     No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
     MARK ANTONY dies
     The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
     O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
     The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
     Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
     And there is nothing left remarkable
     Beneath the visiting moon.
     Faints
CHARMIAN
     O, quietness, lady!
IRAS
     She is dead too, our sovereign.
CHARMIAN
     Lady!
IRAS
     Madam!
CHARMIAN
     O madam, madam, madam!
IRAS
     Royal Egypt, Empress!
CHARMIAN
     Peace, peace, Iras!
CLEOPATRA
     No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
     By such poor passion as the maid that milks
     And does the meanest chares. It were for me
     To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
     To tell them that this world did equal theirs
     Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
     Patience is scottish, and impatience does
     Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
     To rush into the secret house of death,
     Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
     What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
     My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
     Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
     We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
     what's noble,
     Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
     And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
     This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
     Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
     But resolution, and the briefest end.
     Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. ****
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS,
     PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
     Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
     The pauses that he makes.
DOLABELLA
     Caesar, I shall.
     Exit
     Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
     Appear thus to us?
DERCETAS
     I am call'd Dercetas;
     Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
     Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
     He was my master; and I wore my life
     To spend upon his haters. If thou please
     To take me to thee, as I was to him
     I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
     I yield thee up my life.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     What is't thou say'st?
DERCETAS
     I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     The breaking of so great a thing should make
     A greater crack: the round world
     Should have shook lions into civil streets,
     And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
     Is not a single doom; in the name lay
     A moiety of the world.
DERCETAS
     He is dead, Caesar:
     Not by a public minister of justice,
     Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
     Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
     Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
     Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
     I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
     With his most noble blood.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Look you sad, friends?
     The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
     To wash the eyes of kings.
AGRIPPA
     And strange it is,
     That nature must compel us to lament
     Our most persisted deeds.
MECAENAS
     His taints and honours
     Waged equal with him.
AGRIPPA
     A rarer spirit never
     Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
     Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
MECAENAS
     When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
     He needs must see himself.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     O Antony!
     I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
     Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
     Have shown to thee such a declining day,
     Or look on thine; we could not stall together
     In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
     With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
     That thou, my brother, my competitor
     In top of all design, my mate in empire,
     Friend and companion in the front of war,
     The arm of mine own body, and the heart
     Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
     Unreconciliable, should divide
     Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
     But I will tell you at some meeter season:
     Enter an Egyptian
     The business of this man looks out of him;
     We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
Egyptian
     A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
     Confined in all she has, her monument,
     Of thy intents desires instruction,
     That she preparedly may frame herself
     To the way she's forced to.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Bid her have good heart:
     She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
     How honourable and how kindly we
     Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
     To be ungentle.
Egyptian
     So the gods preserve thee!
     Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
     We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
     The quality of her passion shall require,
     Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
     She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
     Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
     And with your speediest bring us what she says,
     And how you find of her.
PROCULEIUS
     Caesar, I shall.
     Exit
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Gallus, go you along.
     Exit GALLUS
     Where's Dolabella,
     To second Proculeius?
All
     Dolabella!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Let him alone, for I remember now
     How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
     Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
     How hardly I was drawn into this war;
     How calm and gentle I proceeded still
     In all my writings: go with me, and see
     What I can show in this.

**** SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument. ****
     Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
CLEOPATRA
     My desolation does begin to make
     A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
     Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
     A minister of her will: and it is great
     To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
     Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
     Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
     The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
     Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers
PROCULEIUS
     Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
     And bids thee study on what fair demands
     Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
CLEOPATRA
     What's thy name?
PROCULEIUS
     My name is Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA
     Antony
     Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
     I do not greatly care to be deceived,
     That have no use for trusting. If your master
     Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
     That majesty, to keep decorum, must
     No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
     To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
     He gives me so much of mine own, as I
     Will kneel to him with thanks.
PROCULEIUS
     Be of good cheer;
     You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:
     Make your full reference freely to my lord,
     Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
     On all that need: let me report to him
     Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
     A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
     Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
CLEOPATRA
     Pray you, tell him
     I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
     The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
     A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
     Look him i' the face.
PROCULEIUS
     This I'll report, dear lady.
     Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
     Of him that caused it.
GALLUS
     You see how easily she may be surprised:
     Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the monument by a ladder
     placed against a window, and, having descended, come behind
     CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates
     To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
     Guard her till Caesar come.
     Exit
IRAS
     Royal queen!
CHARMIAN
     O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
CLEOPATRA
     Quick, quick, good hands.
     Drawing a dagger
PROCULEIUS
     Hold, worthy lady, hold:
     Seizes and disarms her
     Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
     Relieved, but not betray'd.
CLEOPATRA
     What, of death too,
     That rids our dogs of languish?
PROCULEIUS
     Cleopatra,
     Do not abuse my master's bounty by
     The undoing of yourself: let the world see
     His nobleness well acted, which your death
     Will never let come forth.
CLEOPATRA
     Where art thou, death?
     Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
     Worthy many babes and beggars!
PROCULEIUS
     O, temperance, lady!
CLEOPATRA
     Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
     If idle talk will once be necessary,
     I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
     Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
     Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
     Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
     Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
     And show me to the shouting varletry
     Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
     Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
     Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
     Blow me into abhorring! rather make
     My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
     And hang me up in chains!
PROCULEIUS
     You do extend
     These thoughts of horror further than you shall
     Find cause in Caesar.
     Enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA
     Proculeius,
     What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
     And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
     I'll take her to my guard.
PROCULEIUS
     So, Dolabella,
     It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
     To CLEOPATRA
     To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
     If you'll employ me to him.
CLEOPATRA
     Say, I would die.
     Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
DOLABELLA
     Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
CLEOPATRA
     I cannot tell.
DOLABELLA
     Assuredly you know me.
CLEOPATRA
     No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
     You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
     Is't not your trick?
DOLABELLA
     I understand not, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
     O, such another sleep, that I might see
     But such another man!
DOLABELLA
     If it might please ye,--
CLEOPATRA
     His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
     A sun and moon, which kept their course,
     and lighted
     The little O, the earth.
DOLABELLA
     Most sovereign creature,--
CLEOPATRA
     His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
     Crested the world: his voice was propertied
     As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
     But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
     He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
     There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
     That grew the more by reaping: his delights
     Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
     The element they lived in: in his livery
     Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
     As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
DOLABELLA
     Cleopatra!
CLEOPATRA
     Think you there was, or might be, such a man
     As this I dream'd of?
DOLABELLA
     Gentle madam, no.
CLEOPATRA
     You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
     But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
     It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
     To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
     And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
     Condemning shadows quite.
DOLABELLA
     Hear me, good madam.
     Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
     As answering to the weight: would I might never
     O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
     By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
     My very heart at root.
CLEOPATRA
     I thank you, sir,
     Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
DOLABELLA
     I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
CLEOPATRA
     Nay, pray you, sir,--
DOLABELLA
     Though he be honourable,--
CLEOPATRA
     He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
DOLABELLA
     Madam, he will; I know't.
     Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'
     Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and
     others of his Train
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Which is the Queen of Egypt?
DOLABELLA
     It is the emperor, madam.
     CLEOPATRA kneels
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Arise, you shall not kneel:
     I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
CLEOPATRA
     Sir, the gods
     Will have it thus; my master and my lord
     I must obey.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Take to you no hard thoughts:
     The record of what injuries you did us,
     Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
     As things but done by chance.
CLEOPATRA
     Sole sir o' the world,
     I cannot project mine own cause so well
     To make it clear; but do confess I have
     Been laden with like frailties which before
     Have often shamed our sex.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Cleopatra, know,
     We will extenuate rather than enforce:
     If you apply yourself to our intents,
     Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
     A benefit in this change; but if you seek
     To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
     Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
     Of my good purposes, and put your children
     To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
     If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
CLEOPATRA
     And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
     Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
     Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
CLEOPATRA
     This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
     I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
     Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
SELEUCUS
     Here, madam.
CLEOPATRA
     This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
     Upon his peril, that I have reserved
     To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
SELEUCUS
     Madam,
     I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
     Speak that which is not.
CLEOPATRA
     What have I kept back?
SELEUCUS
     Enough to purchase what you have made known.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
     Your wisdom in the deed.
CLEOPATRA
     See, Caesar! O, behold,
     How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
     And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
     The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
     Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
     Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
     Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
     Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
     O rarely base!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Good queen, let us entreat you.
CLEOPATRA
     O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
     That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
     Doing the honour of thy lordliness
     To one so meek, that mine own servant should
     Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
     Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
     That I some lady trifles have reserved,
     Immoment toys, things of such dignity
     As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
     Some nobler token I have kept apart
     For Livia and Octavia, to induce
     Their mediation; must I be unfolded
     With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
     Beneath the fall I have.
     To SELEUCUS
     Prithee, go hence;
     Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
     Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
     Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Forbear, Seleucus.
     Exit SELEUCUS
CLEOPATRA
     Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
     For things that others do; and, when we fall,
     We answer others' merits in our name,
     Are therefore to be pitied.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Cleopatra,
     Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
     Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
     Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
     Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
     Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
     Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
     For we intend so to dispose you as
     Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
     Our care and pity is so much upon you,
     That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
CLEOPATRA
     My master, and my lord!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Not so. Adieu.
     Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train
CLEOPATRA
     He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
     Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
     Whispers CHARMIAN
IRAS
     Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
     And we are for the dark.
CLEOPATRA
     Hie thee again:
     I have spoke already, and it is provided;
     Go put it to the haste.
CHARMIAN
     Madam, I will.
     Re-enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA
     Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN
     Behold, sir.
     Exit
CLEOPATRA
     Dolabella!
DOLABELLA
     Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
     Which my love makes religion to obey,
     I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
     Intends his journey; and within three days
     You with your children will he send before:
     Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
     Your pleasure and my promise.
CLEOPATRA
     Dolabella,
     I shall remain your debtor.
DOLABELLA
     I your servant,
     Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
     Farewell, and thanks.
     Exit DOLABELLA
     Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
     Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
     In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves
     With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
     Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
     Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
     And forced to drink their vapour.
IRAS
     The gods forbid!
CLEOPATRA
     Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
     Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
     Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
     Extemporally will stage us, and present
     Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
     Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
     Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
     I' the posture of a whore.
IRAS
     O the good gods!
CLEOPATRA
     Nay, that's certain.
IRAS
     I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
     Are stronger than mine eyes.
CLEOPATRA
     Why, that's the way
     To fool their preparation, and to conquer
     Their most absurd intents.
     Re-enter CHARMIAN
     Now, Charmian!
     Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
     My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
     To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
     Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
     And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
     To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
     Wherefore's this noise?
     Exit IRAS. A noise within
     Enter a Guardsman
Guard
     Here is a rural fellow
     That will not be denied your highness presence:
     He brings you figs.
CLEOPATRA
     Let him come in.
     Exit Guardsman
     What poor an instrument
     May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
     My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
     Of woman in me: now from head to foot
     I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
     No planet is of mine.
     Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket
Guard
     This is the man.
CLEOPATRA
     Avoid, and leave him.
     Exit Guardsman
     Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
     That kills and pains not?
Clown
     Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
     that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
     is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
     never recover.
CLEOPATRA
     Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
Clown
     Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
     them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
     but something given to lie; as a woman should not
     do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
     biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
     a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
     believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
     half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
     worm's an odd worm.
CLEOPATRA
     Get thee hence; farewell.
Clown
     I wish you all joy of the worm.
     Setting down his basket
CLEOPATRA
     Farewell.
Clown
     You must think this, look you, that the worm will
     do his kind.
CLEOPATRA
     Ay, ay; farewell.
Clown
     Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
     keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
     goodness in worm.
CLEOPATRA
     Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
Clown
     Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
     not worth the feeding.
CLEOPATRA
     Will it eat me?
Clown
     You must not think I am so simple but I know the
     devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
     woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
     not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
     gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
     that they make, the devils mar five.
CLEOPATRA
     Well, get thee gone; farewell.
Clown
     Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
     Exit
     Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, & c
CLEOPATRA
     Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
     Immortal longings in me: now no more
     The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
     Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
     Antony call; I see him rouse himself
     To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
     The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
     To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
     Now to that name my courage prove my title!
     I am fire and air; my other elements
     I give to baser life. So; have you done?
     Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
     Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
     Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
     Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
     If thou and nature can so gently part,
     The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
     Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
     If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
     It is not worth leave-taking.
CHARMIAN
     Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
     The gods themselves do weep!
CLEOPATRA
     This proves me base:
     If she first meet the curled Antony,
     He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
     Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
     mortal wretch,
     To an asp, which she applies to her breast
     With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
     Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
     Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
     That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
     Unpolicied!
CHARMIAN
     O eastern star!
CLEOPATRA
     Peace, peace!
     Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
     That sucks the nurse asleep?
CHARMIAN
     O, break! O, break!
CLEOPATRA
     As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
     O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
     Applying another asp to her arm
     What should I stay--
     Dies
CHARMIAN
     In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
     Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
     A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
     And golden Phoebus never be beheld
     Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
     I'll mend it, and then play.
     Enter the Guard, rushing in
First Guard
     Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN
     Speak softly, wake her not.
First Guard
     Caesar hath sent--
CHARMIAN
     Too slow a messenger.
     Applies an asp
     O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
First Guard
     Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
Second Guard
     There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
First Guard
     What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
CHARMIAN
     It is well done, and fitting for a princess
     Descended of so many royal kings.
     Ah, soldier!
     Dies
     Re-enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA
     How goes it here?
Second Guard
     All dead.
DOLABELLA
     Caesar, thy thoughts
     Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
     To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
     So sought'st to hinder.
     Within 'A way there, a way for Caesar!'
     Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
DOLABELLA
     O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
     That you did fear is done.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Bravest at the last,
     She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
     Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
     I do not see them bleed.
DOLABELLA
     Who was last with them?
First Guard
     A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
     This was his basket.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Poison'd, then.
First Guard
     O Caesar,
     This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
     I found her trimming up the diadem
     On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
     And on the sudden dropp'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     O noble weakness!
     If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
     By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
     As she would catch another Antony
     In her strong toil of grace.
DOLABELLA
     Here, on her breast,
     There is a vent of blood and something blown:
     The like is on her arm.
First Guard
     This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
     Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
     Upon the caves of Nile.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
     Most probable
     That so she died; for her physician tells me
     She hath pursued conclusions infinite
     Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
     And bear her women from the monument:
     She shall be buried by her Antony:
     No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
     A pair so famous. High events as these
     Strike those that make them; and their story is
     No less in pity than his glory which
     Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
     In solemn show attend this funeral;
     And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
     High order in this great solemnity.
     Exeunt
