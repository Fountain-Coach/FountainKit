Romeo and Juliet
**** ACT I ****
**** PROLOGUE ****
     Two households, both alike in dignity,
     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
     Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
     Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
     The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
     And the continuance of their parents' rage,
     Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
     The which if you with patient ears attend,
     What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
**** SCENE I. Verona. A public place. ****
     Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords
     and bucklers
SAMPSON
     Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
GREGORY
     No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMPSON
     I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
GREGORY
     Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
SAMPSON
     I strike quickly, being moved.
GREGORY
     But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
SAMPSON
     A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREGORY
     To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
     therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
SAMPSON
     A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
     take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
GREGORY
     That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
     to the wall.
SAMPSON
     True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
     are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
     Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
     to the wall.
GREGORY
     The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
SAMPSON
     'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
     have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
     maids, and cut off their heads.
GREGORY
     The heads of the maids?
SAMPSON
     Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
     take it in what sense thou wilt.
GREGORY
     They must take it in sense that feel it.
SAMPSON
     Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
     'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
GREGORY
     'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
     hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
     two of the house of the Montagues.
SAMPSON
     My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
GREGORY
     How! turn thy back and run?
SAMPSON
     Fear me not.
GREGORY
     No, marry; I fear thee!
SAMPSON
     Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
GREGORY
     I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
     they list.
SAMPSON
     Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
     which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
     Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
ABRAHAM
     Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON
     I do bite my thumb, sir.
ABRAHAM
     Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON
     [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
     ay?
GREGORY
     No.
SAMPSON
     No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
     bite my thumb, sir.
GREGORY
     Do you quarrel, sir?
ABRAHAM
     Quarrel sir! no, sir.
SAMPSON
     If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
ABRAHAM
     No better.
SAMPSON
     Well, sir.
GREGORY
     Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
SAMPSON
     Yes, better, sir.
ABRAHAM
     You lie.
SAMPSON
     Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
     They fight
     Enter BENVOLIO
BENVOLIO
     Part, fools!
     Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
     Beats down their swords
     Enter TYBALT
TYBALT
     What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
     Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
BENVOLIO
     I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
     Or manage it to part these men with me.
TYBALT
     What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
     As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
     Have at thee, coward!
     They fight
     Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter
     Citizens, with clubs
First Citizen
     Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
     Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
     Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
CAPULET
     What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
LADY CAPULET
     A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
CAPULET
     My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
     And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
     Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
MONTAGUE
     Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
LADY MONTAGUE
     Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
     Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
PRINCE
     Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
     Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
     Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
     That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
     With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
     On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
     Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
     And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
     Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
     By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
     Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
     And made Verona's ancient citizens
     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
     Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
     If ever you disturb our streets again,
     Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
     For this time, all the rest depart away:
     You Capulet; shall go along with me:
     And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
     To know our further pleasure in this case,
     To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
     Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
     Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
MONTAGUE
     Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
     Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BENVOLIO
     Here were the servants of your adversary,
     And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
     I drew to part them: in the instant came
     The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
     Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
     He swung about his head and cut the winds,
     Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
     While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
     Came more and more and fought on part and part,
     Till the prince came, who parted either part.
LADY MONTAGUE
     O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
     Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BENVOLIO
     Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
     Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
     A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
     Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
     That westward rooteth from the city's side,
     So early walking did I see your son:
     Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
     And stole into the covert of the wood:
     I, measuring his affections by my own,
     That most are busied when they're most alone,
     Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
     And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
MONTAGUE
     Many a morning hath he there been seen,
     With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
     Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
     But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
     Should in the furthest east begin to draw
     The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
     Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
     And private in his chamber pens himself,
     Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
     And makes himself an artificial night:
     Black and portentous must this humour prove,
     Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
BENVOLIO
     My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MONTAGUE
     I neither know it nor can learn of him.
BENVOLIO
     Have you importuned him by any means?
MONTAGUE
     Both by myself and many other friends:
     But he, his own affections' counsellor,
     Is to himself--I will not say how true--
     But to himself so secret and so close,
     So far from sounding and discovery,
     As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
     Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
     Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
     Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
     We would as willingly give cure as know.
     Enter ROMEO
BENVOLIO
     See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
     I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
MONTAGUE
     I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
     To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
     Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
BENVOLIO
     Good-morrow, cousin.
ROMEO
     Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO
     But new struck nine.
ROMEO
     Ay me! sad hours seem long.
     Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BENVOLIO
     It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO
     Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLIO
     In love?
ROMEO
     Out--
BENVOLIO
     Of love?
ROMEO
     Out of her favour, where I am in love.
BENVOLIO
     Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
     Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
ROMEO
     Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
     Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
     Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
     Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
     Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
     Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
     O any thing, of nothing first create!
     O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
     Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
     Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
     sick health!
     Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
     This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
     Dost thou not laugh?
BENVOLIO
     No, coz, I rather weep.
ROMEO
     Good heart, at what?
BENVOLIO
     At thy good heart's oppression.
ROMEO
     Why, such is love's transgression.
     Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
     Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
     With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
     Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
     Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
     Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
     Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
     What is it else? a madness most discreet,
     A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
     Farewell, my coz.
BENVOLIO
     Soft! I will go along;
     An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
ROMEO
     Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
     This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
BENVOLIO
     Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
ROMEO
     What, shall I groan and tell thee?
BENVOLIO
     Groan! why, no.
     But sadly tell me who.
ROMEO
     Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
     Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
     In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BENVOLIO
     I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
ROMEO
     A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
BENVOLIO
     A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO
     Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
     With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
     And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
     From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
     She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
     Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
     Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
     O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
     That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
BENVOLIO
     Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO
     She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
     For beauty starved with her severity
     Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
     She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
     To merit bliss by making me despair:
     She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
     Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
BENVOLIO
     Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO
     O, teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLIO
     By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
     Examine other beauties.
ROMEO
     'Tis the way
     To call hers exquisite, in question more:
     These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
     Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
     He that is strucken blind cannot forget
     The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
     Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
     What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
     Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
     Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
BENVOLIO
     I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A street. ****
     Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
CAPULET
     But Montague is bound as well as I,
     In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
     For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARIS
     Of honourable reckoning are you both;
     And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
     But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET
     But saying o'er what I have said before:
     My child is yet a stranger in the world;
     She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
     Let two more summers wither in their pride,
     Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PARIS
     Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAPULET
     And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
     The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
     She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
     But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
     My will to her consent is but a part;
     An she agree, within her scope of choice
     Lies my consent and fair according voice.
     This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
     Whereto I have invited many a guest,
     Such as I love; and you, among the store,
     One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
     At my poor house look to behold this night
     Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
     Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
     When well-apparell'd April on the heel
     Of limping winter treads, even such delight
     Among fresh female buds shall you this night
     Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
     And like her most whose merit most shall be:
     Which on more view, of many mine being one
     May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
     Come, go with me.
     To Servant, giving a paper
     Go, sirrah, trudge about
     Through fair Verona; find those persons out
     Whose names are written there, and to them say,
     My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
     Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
Servant
     Find them out whose names are written here! It is
     written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
     yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
     his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
     sent to find those persons whose names are here
     writ, and can never find what names the writing
     person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
     Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
BENVOLIO
     Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
     One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
     Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
     One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
     Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
     And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROMEO
     Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLIO
     For what, I pray thee?
ROMEO
     For your broken shin.
BENVOLIO
     Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO
     Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
     Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
     Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
Servant
     God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
ROMEO
     Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Servant
     Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
     pray, can you read any thing you see?
ROMEO
     Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Servant
     Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
ROMEO
     Stay, fellow; I can read.
     Reads
     'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
     County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
     widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
     nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
     uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
     Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
     Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
     assembly: whither should they come?
Servant
     Up.
ROMEO
     Whither?
Servant
     To supper; to our house.
ROMEO
     Whose house?
Servant
     My master's.
ROMEO
     Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
Servant
     Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
     great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
     of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
     Rest you merry!
     Exit
BENVOLIO
     At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
     Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
     With all the admired beauties of Verona:
     Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
     Compare her face with some that I shall show,
     And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
ROMEO
     When the devout religion of mine eye
     Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
     And these, who often drown'd could never die,
     Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
     One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
     Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
BENVOLIO
     Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
     Herself poised with herself in either eye:
     But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
     Your lady's love against some other maid
     That I will show you shining at this feast,
     And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
ROMEO
     I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
     But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house. ****
     Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET
     Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
Nurse
     Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
     I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
     God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
     Enter JULIET
JULIET
     How now! who calls?
Nurse
     Your mother.
JULIET
     Madam, I am here.
     What is your will?
LADY CAPULET
     This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
     We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
     I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
     Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Nurse
     Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
LADY CAPULET
     She's not fourteen.
Nurse
     I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
     And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
     She is not fourteen. How long is it now
     To Lammas-tide?
LADY CAPULET
     A fortnight and odd days.
Nurse
     Even or odd, of all days in the year,
     Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
     Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
     Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
     She was too good for me: but, as I said,
     On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
     That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
     'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
     And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
     Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
     For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
     Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
     My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
     Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
     When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
     Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
     To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
     Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
     To bid me trudge:
     And since that time it is eleven years;
     For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
     She could have run and waddled all about;
     For even the day before, she broke her brow:
     And then my husband--God be with his soul!
     A' was a merry man--took up the child:
     'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
     Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
     Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
     The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
     To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
     I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
     I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
     And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
LADY CAPULET
     Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Nurse
     Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
     To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
     And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
     A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
     A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
     'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
     Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
     Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
JULIET
     And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Nurse
     Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
     Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
     An I might live to see thee married once,
     I have my wish.
LADY CAPULET
     Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
     I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
     How stands your disposition to be married?
JULIET
     It is an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse
     An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
     I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
LADY CAPULET
     Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
     Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
     Are made already mothers: by my count,
     I was your mother much upon these years
     That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
     The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Nurse
     A man, young lady! lady, such a man
     As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
LADY CAPULET
     Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nurse
     Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
LADY CAPULET
     What say you? can you love the gentleman?
     This night you shall behold him at our feast;
     Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
     And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
     Examine every married lineament,
     And see how one another lends content
     And what obscured in this fair volume lies
     Find written in the margent of his eyes.
     This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
     To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
     The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
     For fair without the fair within to hide:
     That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
     That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
     So shall you share all that he doth possess,
     By having him, making yourself no less.
Nurse
     No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
LADY CAPULET
     Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
JULIET
     I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
     But no more deep will I endart mine eye
     Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
     Enter a Servant
Servant
     Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
     called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
     the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
     hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
LADY CAPULET
     We follow thee.
     Exit Servant
     Juliet, the county stays.
Nurse
     Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A street. ****
     Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-
     bearers, and others
ROMEO
     What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
     Or shall we on without a apology?
BENVOLIO
     The date is out of such prolixity:
     We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
     Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
     Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
     Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
     After the prompter, for our entrance:
     But let them measure us by what they will;
     We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
ROMEO
     Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
     Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
MERCUTIO
     Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO
     Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
     With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
     So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTIO
     You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
     And soar with them above a common bound.
ROMEO
     I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
     To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
     I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
     Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
MERCUTIO
     And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
     Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROMEO
     Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
     Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
MERCUTIO
     If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
     Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
     Give me a case to put my visage in:
     A visor for a visor! what care I
     What curious eye doth quote deformities?
     Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
BENVOLIO
     Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
     But every man betake him to his legs.
ROMEO
     A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
     Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
     For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
     I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
     The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
MERCUTIO
     Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
     If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
     Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
     Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
ROMEO
     Nay, that's not so.
MERCUTIO
     I mean, sir, in delay
     We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
     Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
     Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROMEO
     And we mean well in going to this mask;
     But 'tis no wit to go.
MERCUTIO
     Why, may one ask?
ROMEO
     I dream'd a dream to-night.
MERCUTIO
     And so did I.
ROMEO
     Well, what was yours?
MERCUTIO
     That dreamers often lie.
ROMEO
     In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
MERCUTIO
     O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
     She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
     In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
     On the fore-finger of an alderman,
     Drawn with a team of little atomies
     Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
     Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
     The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
     The traces of the smallest spider's web,
     The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
     Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
     Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
     Not so big as a round little worm
     Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
     Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
     Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
     Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
     And in this state she gallops night by night
     Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
     O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
     O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
     O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
     Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
     Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
     Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
     And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
     And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
     Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
     Then dreams, he of another benefice:
     Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
     And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
     Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
     Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
     Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
     And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
     And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
     That plats the manes of horses in the night,
     And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
     Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
     This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
     That presses them and learns them first to bear,
     Making them women of good carriage:
     This is she--
ROMEO
     Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
     Thou talk'st of nothing.
MERCUTIO
     True, I talk of dreams,
     Which are the children of an idle brain,
     Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
     Which is as thin of substance as the air
     And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
     Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
     And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
     Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
BENVOLIO
     This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
     Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
ROMEO
     I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
     Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
     Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
     With this night's revels and expire the term
     Of a despised life closed in my breast
     By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
     But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
     Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
BENVOLIO
     Strike, drum.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house. ****
     Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
First Servant
     Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
     shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
Second Servant
     When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
     hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
First Servant
     Away with the joint-stools, remove the
     court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
     me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
     the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
     Antony, and Potpan!
Second Servant
     Ay, boy, ready.
First Servant
     You are looked for and called for, asked for and
     sought for, in the great chamber.
Second Servant
     We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
     brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
     Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the
     Guests and Maskers
CAPULET
     Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
     Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
     Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
     Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
     She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
     Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
     That I have worn a visor and could tell
     A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
     Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
     You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
     A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
     Music plays, and they dance
     More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
     And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
     Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
     Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
     For you and I are past our dancing days:
     How long is't now since last yourself and I
     Were in a mask?
Second Capulet
     By'r lady, thirty years.
CAPULET
     What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
     'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
     Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
     Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
Second Capulet
     'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
     His son is thirty.
CAPULET
     Will you tell me that?
     His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROMEO
     [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
     enrich the hand
     Of yonder knight?
Servant
     I know not, sir.
ROMEO
     O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
     It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
     Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
     Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
     So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
     As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
     The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
     And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
     Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
     For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
TYBALT
     This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
     Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
     Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
     To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
     Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
     To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET
     Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT
     Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
     A villain that is hither come in spite,
     To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAPULET
     Young Romeo is it?
TYBALT
     'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
CAPULET
     Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
     He bears him like a portly gentleman;
     And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
     To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
     I would not for the wealth of all the town
     Here in my house do him disparagement:
     Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
     It is my will, the which if thou respect,
     Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
     And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYBALT
     It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
     I'll not endure him.
CAPULET
     He shall be endured:
     What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
     Am I the master here, or you? go to.
     You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
     You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
     You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
TYBALT
     Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
CAPULET
     Go to, go to;
     You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
     This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
     You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
     Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
     Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
     I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
TYBALT
     Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
     Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
     I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
     Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
     Exit
ROMEO
     [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
     This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
     My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
     To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET
     Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
     Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
     For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
     And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROMEO
     Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET
     Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO
     O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
     They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULIET
     Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROMEO
     Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
     Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
JULIET
     Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO
     Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
     Give me my sin again.
JULIET
     You kiss by the book.
Nurse
     Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROMEO
     What is her mother?
Nurse
     Marry, bachelor,
     Her mother is the lady of the house,
     And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
     I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
     I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
     Shall have the chinks.
ROMEO
     Is she a Capulet?
     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
BENVOLIO
     Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO
     Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
CAPULET
     Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
     We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
     Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
     I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
     More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
     Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
     I'll to my rest.
     Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
JULIET
     Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Nurse
     The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JULIET
     What's he that now is going out of door?
Nurse
     Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
JULIET
     What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
Nurse
     I know not.
JULIET
     Go ask his name: if he be married.
     My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
Nurse
     His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
     The only son of your great enemy.
JULIET
     My only love sprung from my only hate!
     Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
     Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
     That I must love a loathed enemy.
Nurse
     What's this? what's this?
JULIET
     A rhyme I learn'd even now
     Of one I danced withal.
     One calls within 'Juliet.'
Nurse
     Anon, anon!
     Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

**** ACT II ****
**** PROLOGUE ****
     Enter Chorus
Chorus
     Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
     And young affection gapes to be his heir;
     That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
     With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
     Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
     Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
     But to his foe supposed he must complain,
     And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
     Being held a foe, he may not have access
     To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
     And she as much in love, her means much less
     To meet her new-beloved any where:
     But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
     Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
     Exit
**** SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard. ****
     Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
     Can I go forward when my heart is here?
     Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
     He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
     Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
BENVOLIO
     Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
MERCUTIO
     He is wise;
     And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
BENVOLIO
     He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
     Call, good Mercutio.
MERCUTIO
     Nay, I'll conjure too.
     Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
     Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
     Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
     Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
     Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
     One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
     Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
     When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
     He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
     The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
     I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
     By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
     By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
     And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
     That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
BENVOLIO
     And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MERCUTIO
     This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
     To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
     Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
     Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
     That were some spite: my invocation
     Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
     I conjure only but to raise up him.
BENVOLIO
     Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
     To be consorted with the humorous night:
     Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
MERCUTIO
     If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
     Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
     And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
     As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
     Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
     An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
     Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
     This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
     Come, shall we go?
BENVOLIO
     Go, then; for 'tis in vain
     To seek him here that means not to be found.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Capulet's orchard. ****
     Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
     He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
     JULIET appears above at a window
     But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
     It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
     Who is already sick and pale with grief,
     That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
     Be not her maid, since she is envious;
     Her vestal livery is but sick and green
     And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
     It is my lady, O, it is my love!
     O, that she knew she were!
     She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
     I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
     Having some business, do entreat her eyes
     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
     Would through the airy region stream so bright
     That birds would sing and think it were not night.
     See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
     O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
     That I might touch that cheek!
JULIET
     Ay me!
ROMEO
     She speaks:
     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
     As is a winged messenger of heaven
     Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
     And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULIET
     O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
     Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO
     [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET
     'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
     What's in a name? that which we call a rose
     By any other name would smell as sweet;
     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
     Retain that dear perfection which he owes
     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
     And for that name which is no part of thee
     Take all myself.
ROMEO
     I take thee at thy word:
     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULIET
     What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
     So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO
     By a name
     I know not how to tell thee who I am:
     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
     Because it is an enemy to thee;
     Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET
     My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
     Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
ROMEO
     Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
JULIET
     How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
     And the place death, considering who thou art,
     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROMEO
     With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
     For stony limits cannot hold love out,
     And what love can do that dares love attempt;
     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
JULIET
     If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO
     Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
     Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
     And I am proof against their enmity.
JULIET
     I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO
     I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
     And but thou love me, let them find me here:
     My life were better ended by their hate,
     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULIET
     By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROMEO
     By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
     He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
     I would adventure for such merchandise.
JULIET
     Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
     Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
     What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
     Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
     And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
     Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
     Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
     Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
     I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
     And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
     I should have been more strange, I must confess,
     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
     My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
     And not impute this yielding to light love,
     Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROMEO
     Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
JULIET
     O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
     That monthly changes in her circled orb,
     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROMEO
     What shall I swear by?
JULIET
     Do not swear at all;
     Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
     Which is the god of my idolatry,
     And I'll believe thee.
ROMEO
     If my heart's dear love--
JULIET
     Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
     I have no joy of this contract to-night:
     It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
     May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
     Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROMEO
     O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULIET
     What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROMEO
     The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULIET
     I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
     And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO
     Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
JULIET
     But to be frank, and give it thee again.
     And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
     The more I have, for both are infinite.
     Nurse calls within
     I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
     Stay but a little, I will come again.
     Exit, above
ROMEO
     O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
     Being in night, all this is but a dream,
     Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
     Re-enter JULIET, above
JULIET
     Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
     If that thy bent of love be honourable,
     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Nurse
     [Within] Madam!
JULIET
     I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
     I do beseech thee--
Nurse
     [Within] Madam!
JULIET
     By and by, I come:--
     To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
     To-morrow will I send.
ROMEO
     So thrive my soul--
JULIET
     A thousand times good night!
     Exit, above
ROMEO
     A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
     Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
     their books,
     But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
     Retiring
     Re-enter JULIET, above
JULIET
     Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
     Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
     With repetition of my Romeo's name.
ROMEO
     It is my soul that calls upon my name:
     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
     Like softest music to attending ears!
JULIET
     Romeo!
ROMEO
     My dear?
JULIET
     At what o'clock to-morrow
     Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO
     At the hour of nine.
JULIET
     I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
     I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROMEO
     Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULIET
     I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
     Remembering how I love thy company.
ROMEO
     And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
     Forgetting any other home but this.
JULIET
     'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
     And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
     Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
     So loving-jealous of his liberty.
ROMEO
     I would I were thy bird.
JULIET
     Sweet, so would I:
     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
     Good night, good night! parting is such
     sweet sorrow,
     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
     Exit above
ROMEO
     Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
     His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell. ****
     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
FRIAR LAURENCE
     The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
     Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
     Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
     What is her burying grave that is her womb,
     And from her womb children of divers kind
     We sucking on her natural bosom find,
     Many for many virtues excellent,
     None but for some and yet all different.
     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
     In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
     For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
     But to the earth some special good doth give,
     Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
     And vice sometimes by action dignified.
     Within the infant rind of this small flower
     Poison hath residence and medicine power:
     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
     Two such opposed kings encamp them still
     In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
     And where the worser is predominant,
     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
     Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
     Good morrow, father.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Benedicite!
     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
     Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
     And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
     Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
     Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
ROMEO
     That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
ROMEO
     With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
ROMEO
     I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
     I have been feasting with mine enemy,
     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
     That's by me wounded: both our remedies
     Within thy help and holy physic lies:
     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
     My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO
     Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
     And all combined, save what thou must combine
     By holy marriage: when and where and how
     We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
     That thou consent to marry us to-day.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
     Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
     So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
     Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
     How much salt water thrown away in waste,
     To season love, that of it doth not taste!
     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
     Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
     If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
     And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
     Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
ROMEO
     Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROMEO
     And bad'st me bury love.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Not in a grave,
     To lay one in, another out to have.
ROMEO
     I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
     The other did not so.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     O, she knew well
     Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
     But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
     For this alliance may so happy prove,
     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
ROMEO
     O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A street. ****
     Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
MERCUTIO
     Where the devil should this Romeo be?
     Came he not home to-night?
BENVOLIO
     Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
MERCUTIO
     Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
     Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
BENVOLIO
     Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
MERCUTIO
     A challenge, on my life.
BENVOLIO
     Romeo will answer it.
MERCUTIO
     Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BENVOLIO
     Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
     dares, being dared.
MERCUTIO
     Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
     white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
     love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
     blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
     encounter Tybalt?
BENVOLIO
     Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTIO
     More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
     the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
     you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
     proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
     the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
     button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
     very first house, of the first and second cause:
     ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
     hai!
BENVOLIO
     The what?
MERCUTIO
     The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
     fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
     a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
     whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
     grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
     these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
     perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
     that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
     bones, their bones!
     Enter ROMEO
BENVOLIO
     Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
MERCUTIO
     Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
     how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
     that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
     kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
     be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
     eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
     Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
     to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
     fairly last night.
ROMEO
     Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO
     The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
ROMEO
     Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
     such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTIO
     That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
     constrains a man to bow in the hams.
ROMEO
     Meaning, to court'sy.
MERCUTIO
     Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO
     A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTIO
     Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROMEO
     Pink for flower.
MERCUTIO
     Right.
ROMEO
     Why, then is my pump well flowered.
MERCUTIO
     Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
     worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
     is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
ROMEO
     O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
     singleness.
MERCUTIO
     Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
ROMEO
     Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
MERCUTIO
     Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
     done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
     thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
     was I with you there for the goose?
ROMEO
     Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
     not there for the goose.
MERCUTIO
     I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROMEO
     Nay, good goose, bite not.
MERCUTIO
     Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
     sharp sauce.
ROMEO
     And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
MERCUTIO
     O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
     inch narrow to an ell broad!
ROMEO
     I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
     to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
MERCUTIO
     Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
     now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
     thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
     for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
     that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
BENVOLIO
     Stop there, stop there.
MERCUTIO
     Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BENVOLIO
     Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MERCUTIO
     O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
     for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
     meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
ROMEO
     Here's goodly gear!
     Enter Nurse and PETER
MERCUTIO
     A sail, a sail!
BENVOLIO
     Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
Nurse
     Peter!
PETER
     Anon!
Nurse
     My fan, Peter.
MERCUTIO
     Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
     fairer face.
Nurse
     God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
MERCUTIO
     God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
Nurse
     Is it good den?
MERCUTIO
     'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
     dial is now upon the prick of noon.
Nurse
     Out upon you! what a man are you!
ROMEO
     One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
     mar.
Nurse
     By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
     quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
     may find the young Romeo?
ROMEO
     I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
     you have found him than he was when you sought him:
     I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
Nurse
     You say well.
MERCUTIO
     Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
     wisely, wisely.
Nurse
     if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
     you.
BENVOLIO
     She will indite him to some supper.
MERCUTIO
     A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
ROMEO
     What hast thou found?
MERCUTIO
     No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
     that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
     Sings
     An old hare hoar,
     And an old hare hoar,
     Is very good meat in lent
     But a hare that is hoar
     Is too much for a score,
     When it hoars ere it be spent.
     Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
     to dinner, thither.
ROMEO
     I will follow you.
MERCUTIO
     Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
     Singing
     'lady, lady, lady.'
     Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
Nurse
     Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
     merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
ROMEO
     A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
     and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
     to in a month.
Nurse
     An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
     down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
     Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
     Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
     none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
     too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
PETER
     I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
     should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
     draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
     good quarrel, and the law on my side.
Nurse
     Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
     me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
     and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
     out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
     but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
     a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
     kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
     is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
     with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
     to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
ROMEO
     Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
     protest unto thee--
Nurse
     Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
     Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
ROMEO
     What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
Nurse
     I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
     I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
ROMEO
     Bid her devise
     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
     Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
Nurse
     No truly sir; not a penny.
ROMEO
     Go to; I say you shall.
Nurse
     This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
ROMEO
     And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
     Within this hour my man shall be with thee
     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
     Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
     Must be my convoy in the secret night.
     Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
     Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
Nurse
     Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
ROMEO
     What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
Nurse
     Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
ROMEO
     I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
NURSE
     Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
     Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
     is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
     lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
     see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
     sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
     man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
     as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
     rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
ROMEO
     Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
Nurse
     Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
     the--No; I know it begins with some other
     letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
     it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
     to hear it.
ROMEO
     Commend me to thy lady.
Nurse
     Ay, a thousand times.
     Exit Romeo
     Peter!
PETER
     Anon!
Nurse
     Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Capulet's orchard. ****
     Enter JULIET
JULIET
     The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
     In half an hour she promised to return.
     Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
     O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
     Driving back shadows over louring hills:
     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
     Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
     And his to me:
     But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
     O God, she comes!
     Enter Nurse and PETER
     O honey nurse, what news?
     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Nurse
     Peter, stay at the gate.
     Exit PETER
JULIET
     Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
     By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Nurse
     I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
     Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
JULIET
     I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
     Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
Nurse
     Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
     Do you not see that I am out of breath?
JULIET
     How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
     To say to me that thou art out of breath?
     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
     Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
Nurse
     Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
     how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
     face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
     all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
     though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
     past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
     but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
     ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
JULIET
     No, no: but all this did I know before.
     What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Nurse
     Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
     My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
     Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
     To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
JULIET
     I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
     Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Nurse
     Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
     courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
     warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
JULIET
     Where is my mother! why, she is within;
     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
     Where is your mother?'
Nurse
     O God's lady dear!
     Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
     Henceforward do your messages yourself.
JULIET
     Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Nurse
     Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
JULIET
     I have.
Nurse
     Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
     There stays a husband to make you a wife:
     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
     Hie you to church; I must another way,
     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
     I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
     But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
     Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
JULIET
     Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell. ****
     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
FRIAR LAURENCE
     So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
     That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
ROMEO
     Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
     That one short minute gives me in her sight:
     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
     Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
     It is enough I may but call her mine.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     These violent delights have violent ends
     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
     Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
     Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
     And in the taste confounds the appetite:
     Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
     Enter JULIET
     Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
     A lover may bestride the gossamer
     That idles in the wanton summer air,
     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
JULIET
     Good even to my ghostly confessor.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
JULIET
     As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
ROMEO
     Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
     Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
     Unfold the imagined happiness that both
     Receive in either by this dear encounter.
JULIET
     Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
     Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
     They are but beggars that can count their worth;
     But my true love is grown to such excess
     I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
     Till holy church incorporate two in one.

**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. A public place. ****
     Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
BENVOLIO
     I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
     And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MERCUTIO
     Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
     enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
     upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
     thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
     it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLIO
     Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTIO
     Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
     any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
     soon moody to be moved.
BENVOLIO
     And what to?
MERCUTIO
     Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
     shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
     thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
     or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
     wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
     eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
     Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
     meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
     an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
     man for coughing in the street, because he hath
     wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
     didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
     his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
     tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
     wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
BENVOLIO
     An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
     should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
MERCUTIO
     The fee-simple! O simple!
BENVOLIO
     By my head, here come the Capulets.
MERCUTIO
     By my heel, I care not.
     Enter TYBALT and others
TYBALT
     Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
     Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
MERCUTIO
     And but one word with one of us? couple it with
     something; make it a word and a blow.
TYBALT
     You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
     will give me occasion.
MERCUTIO
     Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT
     Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
MERCUTIO
     Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
     thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
     discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
     make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
BENVOLIO
     We talk here in the public haunt of men:
     Either withdraw unto some private place,
     And reason coldly of your grievances,
     Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTIO
     Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
     I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
     Enter ROMEO
TYBALT
     Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
MERCUTIO
     But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
     Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
TYBALT
     Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
     No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
ROMEO
     Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
     To such a greeting: villain am I none;
     Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
TYBALT
     Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
ROMEO
     I do protest, I never injured thee,
     But love thee better than thou canst devise,
     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
     And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
     As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
MERCUTIO
     O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
     Alla stoccata carries it away.
     Draws
     Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
TYBALT
     What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTIO
     Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
     lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
     shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
     eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
     by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
     ears ere it be out.
TYBALT
     I am for you.
     Drawing
ROMEO
     Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
MERCUTIO
     Come, sir, your passado.
     They fight
ROMEO
     Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
     Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
     Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
     Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
     Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
     TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
MERCUTIO
     I am hurt.
     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
     Is he gone, and hath nothing?
BENVOLIO
     What, art thou hurt?
MERCUTIO
     Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
     Exit Page
ROMEO
     Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
MERCUTIO
     No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
     church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
     me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
     am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
     both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
     cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
     rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
     arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
     was hurt under your arm.
ROMEO
     I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO
     Help me into some house, Benvolio,
     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
     They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
     And soundly too: your houses!
     Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
ROMEO
     This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
     My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
     In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
     With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
     Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
     And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
     Re-enter BENVOLIO
BENVOLIO
     O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
     That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
ROMEO
     This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
     This but begins the woe, others must end.
BENVOLIO
     Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROMEO
     Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
     Away to heaven, respective lenity,
     And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
     Re-enter TYBALT
     Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
     Is but a little way above our heads,
     Staying for thine to keep him company:
     Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
TYBALT
     Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
     Shalt with him hence.
ROMEO
     This shall determine that.
     They fight; TYBALT falls
BENVOLIO
     Romeo, away, be gone!
     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
     Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
     If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
ROMEO
     O, I am fortune's fool!
BENVOLIO
     Why dost thou stay?
     Exit ROMEO
     Enter Citizens, & c
First Citizen
     Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
     Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
BENVOLIO
     There lies that Tybalt.
First Citizen
     Up, sir, go with me;
     I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
     Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
PRINCE
     Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BENVOLIO
     O noble prince, I can discover all
     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
LADY CAPULET
     Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
     O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
     O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
     For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
     O cousin, cousin!
PRINCE
     Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BENVOLIO
     Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
     Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
     How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
     Your high displeasure: all this uttered
     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
     Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
     Cold death aside, and with the other sends
     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
     Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
     'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
     his tongue,
     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
     But by and by comes back to Romeo,
     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
     And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
LADY CAPULET
     He is a kinsman to the Montague;
     Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
     And all those twenty could but kill one life.
     I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
     Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
PRINCE
     Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MONTAGUE
     Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
     His fault concludes but what the law should end,
     The life of Tybalt.
PRINCE
     And for that offence
     Immediately we do exile him hence:
     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
     That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
     Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
     Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
     Bear hence this body and attend our will:
     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Capulet's orchard. ****
     Enter JULIET
JULIET
     Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
     Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
     As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
     And bring in cloudy night immediately.
     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
     That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
     Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
     And learn me how to lose a winning match,
     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
     With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
     Think true love acted simple modesty.
     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
     Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
     Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
     Take him and cut him out in little stars,
     And he will make the face of heaven so fine
     That all the world will be in love with night
     And pay no worship to the garish sun.
     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
     But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
     Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
     As is the night before some festival
     To an impatient child that hath new robes
     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
     And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
     Enter Nurse, with cords
     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
     That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Nurse
     Ay, ay, the cords.
     Throws them down
JULIET
     Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Nurse
     Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
     We are undone, lady, we are undone!
     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
JULIET
     Can heaven be so envious?
Nurse
     Romeo can,
     Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
JULIET
     What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
     Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
     I am not I, if there be such an I;
     Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
     If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Nurse
     I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
     God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
     All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
JULIET
     O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
     To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
Nurse
     O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
     That ever I should live to see thee dead!
JULIET
     What storm is this that blows so contrary?
     Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
     My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
     For who is living, if those two are gone?
Nurse
     Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
JULIET
     O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Nurse
     It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
JULIET
     O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
     Despised substance of divinest show!
     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
     A damned saint, an honourable villain!
     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
     In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
     Was ever book containing such vile matter
     So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
     In such a gorgeous palace!
Nurse
     There's no trust,
     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
     Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
     Shame come to Romeo!
JULIET
     Blister'd be thy tongue
     For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
     Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
     Sole monarch of the universal earth.
     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Nurse
     Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
JULIET
     Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
     But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
     Your tributary drops belong to woe,
     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
     That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
     But, O, it presses to my memory,
     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
     Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
     Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
     Which modern lamentations might have moved?
     But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
     'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
     Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
Nurse
     Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
JULIET
     Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
     Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
     Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
     He made you for a highway to my bed;
     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
     Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
Nurse
     Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
     To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
JULIET
     O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
     And bid him come to take his last farewell.

     Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
     That I yet know not?
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Too familiar
     Is my dear son with such sour company:
     I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
ROMEO
     What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
FRIAR LAURENCE
     A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
     Not body's death, but body's banishment.
ROMEO
     Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
     For exile hath more terror in his look,
     Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Hence from Verona art thou banished:
     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROMEO
     There is no world without Verona walls,
     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
     Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
     And world's exile is death: then banished,
     Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
     Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
     Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
     Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
     And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
     This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
ROMEO
     'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
     Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
     And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
     Live here in heaven and may look on her;
     But Romeo may not: more validity,
     More honourable state, more courtship lives
     In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
     On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
     And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
     Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
     Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
     But Romeo may not; he is banished:
     Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
     They are free men, but I am banished.
     And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
     Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
     No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
     But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
     O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
     Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
     Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
     A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
     To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
ROMEO
     O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
     Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
     To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
ROMEO
     Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
     Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
     Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
     It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
ROMEO
     How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
ROMEO
     Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
     Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
     An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
     Doting like me and like me banished,
     Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
     And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
     Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
     Knocking within
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
ROMEO
     Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
     Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
     Knocking
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
     Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
     Knocking
     Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
     What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
     Knocking
     Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
Nurse
     [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
     my errand;
     I come from Lady Juliet.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Welcome, then.
     Enter Nurse
Nurse
     O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
     Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
FRIAR LAURENCE
     There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Nurse
     O, he is even in my mistress' case,
     Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
     Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
     Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
     Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
     For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
     Why should you fall into so deep an O?
ROMEO
     Nurse!
Nurse
     Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
ROMEO
     Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
     Doth she not think me an old murderer,
     Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
     With blood removed but little from her own?
     Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
     My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
Nurse
     O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
     And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
     And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
     And then down falls again.
ROMEO
     As if that name,
     Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
     Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
     Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
     In what vile part of this anatomy
     Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
     The hateful mansion.
     Drawing his sword
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Hold thy desperate hand:
     Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
     Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
     The unreasonable fury of a beast:
     Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
     Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
     Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
     I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
     Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
     And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
     By doing damned hate upon thyself?
     Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
     Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
     In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
     Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
     Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
     And usest none in that true use indeed
     Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
     Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
     Digressing from the valour of a man;
     Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
     Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
     Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
     Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
     Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
     Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
     And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
     What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
     For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
     There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
     But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
     The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
     And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
     A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
     Happiness courts thee in her best array;
     But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
     Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
     Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
     Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
     Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
     But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
     For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
     Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
     To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
     Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
     With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
     Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
     Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
     And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
     Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
     Romeo is coming.
Nurse
     O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
     To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
     My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
ROMEO
     Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Nurse
     Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
     Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
     Exit
ROMEO
     How well my comfort is revived by this!
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
     Either be gone before the watch be set,
     Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
     Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
     And he shall signify from time to time
     Every good hap to you that chances here:
     Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
ROMEO
     But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
     It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house. ****
     Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
CAPULET
     Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
     That we have had no time to move our daughter:
     Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
     And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
     'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
     I promise you, but for your company,
     I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
PARIS
     These times of woe afford no time to woo.
     Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
LADY CAPULET
     I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
     To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
CAPULET
     Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
     Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
     In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
     Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
     Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
     And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
     But, soft! what day is this?
PARIS
     Monday, my lord,
CAPULET
     Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
     O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
     She shall be married to this noble earl.
     Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
     We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
     For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
     It may be thought we held him carelessly,
     Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
     Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
     And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
PARIS
     My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
CAPULET
     Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
     Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
     Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
     Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
     Afore me! it is so very very late,
     That we may call it early by and by.
     Good night.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Capulet's orchard. ****
     Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
JULIET
     Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
     It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
     That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
     Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
     Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
ROMEO
     It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
     No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
     Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
     Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
     Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
     I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULIET
     Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
     It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
     To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
     And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
     Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
ROMEO
     Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
     I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
     I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
     'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
     Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
     The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
     I have more care to stay than will to go:
     Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
     How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
JULIET
     It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
     It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
     Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
     Some say the lark makes sweet division;
     This doth not so, for she divideth us:
     Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
     O, now I would they had changed voices too!
     Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
     Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
     O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
ROMEO
     More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
     Enter Nurse, to the chamber
Nurse
     Madam!
JULIET
     Nurse?
Nurse
     Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
     The day is broke; be wary, look about.
     Exit
JULIET
     Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
ROMEO
     Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
     He goeth down
JULIET
     Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
     I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
     For in a minute there are many days:
     O, by this count I shall be much in years
     Ere I again behold my Romeo!
ROMEO
     Farewell!
     I will omit no opportunity
     That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET
     O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO
     I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
     For sweet discourses in our time to come.
JULIET
     O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
     Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
     As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
     Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
ROMEO
     And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
     Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
     Exit
JULIET
     O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
     If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
     That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
     For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
     But send him back.
LADY CAPULET
     [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
JULIET
     Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
     Is she not down so late, or up so early?
     What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
     Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET
     Why, how now, Juliet!
JULIET
     Madam, I am not well.
LADY CAPULET
     Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
     What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
     An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
     Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
     But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
JULIET
     Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
LADY CAPULET
     So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
     Which you weep for.
JULIET
     Feeling so the loss,
     Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
LADY CAPULET
     Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
     As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
JULIET
     What villain madam?
LADY CAPULET
     That same villain, Romeo.
JULIET
     [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
     God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
     And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
LADY CAPULET
     That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
JULIET
     Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
     Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
LADY CAPULET
     We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
     Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
     Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
     Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
     That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
     And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
JULIET
     Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
     With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
     Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
     Madam, if you could find out but a man
     To bear a poison, I would temper it;
     That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
     Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
     To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
     To wreak the love I bore my cousin
     Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
LADY CAPULET
     Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
     But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
JULIET
     And joy comes well in such a needy time:
     What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
LADY CAPULET
     Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
     One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
     Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
     That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
JULIET
     Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
LADY CAPULET
     Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
     The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
     The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
     Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
JULIET
     Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
     He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
     I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
     Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
     I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
     I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
     It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
     Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
LADY CAPULET
     Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
     And see how he will take it at your hands.
     Enter CAPULET and Nurse
CAPULET
     When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
     But for the sunset of my brother's son
     It rains downright.
     How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
     Evermore showering? In one little body
     Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
     For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
     Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
     Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
     Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
     Without a sudden calm, will overset
     Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
     Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
LADY CAPULET
     Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
     I would the fool were married to her grave!
CAPULET
     Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
     How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
     Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
     Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
     So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
JULIET
     Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
     Proud can I never be of what I hate;
     But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
CAPULET
     How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
     'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
     And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
     Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
     But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
     To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
     Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
     Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
     You tallow-face!
LADY CAPULET
     Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
JULIET
     Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
     Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
CAPULET
     Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
     I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
     Or never after look me in the face:
     Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
     My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
     That God had lent us but this only child;
     But now I see this one is one too much,
     And that we have a curse in having her:
     Out on her, hilding!
Nurse
     God in heaven bless her!
     You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
CAPULET
     And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
     Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
Nurse
     I speak no treason.
CAPULET
     O, God ye god-den.
Nurse
     May not one speak?
CAPULET
     Peace, you mumbling fool!
     Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
     For here we need it not.
LADY CAPULET
     You are too hot.
CAPULET
     God's bread! it makes me mad:
     Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
     Alone, in company, still my care hath been
     To have her match'd: and having now provided
     A gentleman of noble parentage,
     Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
     Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
     Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
     And then to have a wretched puling fool,
     A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
     To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
     I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
     But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
     Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
     Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
     Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
     An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
     And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
     the streets,
     For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
     Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
     Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
     Exit
JULIET
     Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
     That sees into the bottom of my grief?
     O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
     Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
     Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
     In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
LADY CAPULET
     Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
     Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
     Exit
JULIET
     O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
     My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
     How shall that faith return again to earth,
     Unless that husband send it me from heaven
     By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
     Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
     Upon so soft a subject as myself!
     What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
     Some comfort, nurse.
Nurse
     Faith, here it is.
     Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
     That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
     Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
     Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
     I think it best you married with the county.
     O, he's a lovely gentleman!
     Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
     Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
     As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
     I think you are happy in this second match,
     For it excels your first: or if it did not,
     Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
     As living here and you no use of him.
JULIET
     Speakest thou from thy heart?
Nurse
     And from my soul too;
     Or else beshrew them both.
JULIET
     Amen!
Nurse
     What?
JULIET
     Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
     Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
     Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
     To make confession and to be absolved.
Nurse
     Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
     Exit
JULIET
     Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
     Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
     Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
     Which she hath praised him with above compare
     So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
     Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
     I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
     If all else fail, myself have power to die.

**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell. ****
     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
FRIAR LAURENCE
     On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
PARIS
     My father Capulet will have it so;
     And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     You say you do not know the lady's mind:
     Uneven is the course, I like it not.
PARIS
     Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
     And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
     For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
     Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
     That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
     And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
     To stop the inundation of her tears;
     Which, too much minded by herself alone,
     May be put from her by society:
     Now do you know the reason of this haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
     Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
     Enter JULIET
PARIS
     Happily met, my lady and my wife!
JULIET
     That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
PARIS
     That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
JULIET
     What must be shall be.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     That's a certain text.
PARIS
     Come you to make confession to this father?
JULIET
     To answer that, I should confess to you.
PARIS
     Do not deny to him that you love me.
JULIET
     I will confess to you that I love him.
PARIS
     So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
JULIET
     If I do so, it will be of more price,
     Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
PARIS
     Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
JULIET
     The tears have got small victory by that;
     For it was bad enough before their spite.
PARIS
     Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
JULIET
     That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
     And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
PARIS
     Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
JULIET
     It may be so, for it is not mine own.
     Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
     Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
FRIAR LAURENCE
     My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
     My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
PARIS
     God shield I should disturb devotion!
     Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
     Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
     Exit
JULIET
     O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
     Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
     It strains me past the compass of my wits:
     I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
     On Thursday next be married to this county.
JULIET
     Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
     Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
     If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
     Do thou but call my resolution wise,
     And with this knife I'll help it presently.
     God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
     And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
     Shall be the label to another deed,
     Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
     Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
     Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
     Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
     'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
     Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
     Which the commission of thy years and art
     Could to no issue of true honour bring.
     Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
     If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
     Which craves as desperate an execution.
     As that is desperate which we would prevent.
     If, rather than to marry County Paris,
     Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
     Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
     A thing like death to chide away this shame,
     That copest with death himself to scape from it:
     And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
JULIET
     O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
     From off the battlements of yonder tower;
     Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
     Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
     Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
     O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
     With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
     Or bid me go into a new-made grave
     And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
     Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
     And I will do it without fear or doubt,
     To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
     To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
     To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
     Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
     Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
     And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
     When presently through all thy veins shall run
     A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
     Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
     No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
     The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
     To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
     Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
     Each part, deprived of supple government,
     Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
     And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
     Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
     And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
     Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
     To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
     Then, as the manner of our country is,
     In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
     Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
     Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
     In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
     Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
     And hither shall he come: and he and I
     Will watch thy waking, and that very night
     Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
     And this shall free thee from this present shame;
     If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
     Abate thy valour in the acting it.
JULIET
     Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
     In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
     To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
JULIET
     Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
     Farewell, dear father!
     Exeunt

CAPULET
     So many guests invite as here are writ.
     Exit First Servant
     Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
Second Servant
     You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
     can lick their fingers.
CAPULET
     How canst thou try them so?
Second Servant
     Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
     own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
     fingers goes not with me.
CAPULET
     Go, be gone.
     Exit Second Servant
     We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
     What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Nurse
     Ay, forsooth.
CAPULET
     Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
     A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
Nurse
     See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
     Enter JULIET
CAPULET
     How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
JULIET
     Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
     Of disobedient opposition
     To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
     By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
     And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
     Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
CAPULET
     Send for the county; go tell him of this:
     I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
JULIET
     I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
     And gave him what becomed love I might,
     Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
CAPULET
     Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
     This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
     Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
     Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
     Our whole city is much bound to him.
JULIET
     Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
     To help me sort such needful ornaments
     As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
LADY CAPULET
     No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
CAPULET
     Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
     Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
LADY CAPULET
     We shall be short in our provision:
     'Tis now near night.
CAPULET
     Tush, I will stir about,
     And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
     Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
     I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
     I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
     They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
     To County Paris, to prepare him up
     Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
     Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Juliet's chamber. ****
     Enter JULIET and Nurse
JULIET
     Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
     I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
     For I have need of many orisons
     To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
     Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
     Enter LADY CAPULET
LADY CAPULET
     What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
JULIET
     No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
     As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
     So please you, let me now be left alone,
     And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
     For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
     In this so sudden business.
LADY CAPULET
     Good night:
     Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
     Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
JULIET
     Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
     I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
     That almost freezes up the heat of life:
     I'll call them back again to comfort me:
     Nurse! What should she do here?
     My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
     Come, vial.
     What if this mixture do not work at all?
     Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
     No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
     Laying down her dagger
     What if it be a poison, which the friar
     Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
     Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
     Because he married me before to Romeo?
     I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
     For he hath still been tried a holy man.
     How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
     I wake before the time that Romeo
     Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
     Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
     To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
     And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
     Or, if I live, is it not very like,
     The horrible conceit of death and night,
     Together with the terror of the place,--
     As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
     Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
     Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
     Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
     Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
     At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
     Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
     So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
     And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
     O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
     Environed with all these hideous fears?
     And madly play with my forefather's joints?
     And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
     And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
     As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
     O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
     Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
     Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
     Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
     She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

CAPULET
     Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
     The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
     Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
     Spare not for the cost.
Nurse
     Go, you cot-quean, go,
     Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
     For this night's watching.
CAPULET
     No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
     All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
LADY CAPULET
     Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
     But I will watch you from such watching now.

     Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
     Now, fellow,
     What's there?
First Servant
     Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
CAPULET
     Make haste, make haste.
     Exit First Servant
     Sirrah, fetch drier logs:

     Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
     What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
     Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
     The County Paris hath set up his rest,
     That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
     Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
     I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
     Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
     He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
     Undraws the curtains
     What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!

     Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
CAPULET
     Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
     Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
     Life and these lips have long been separated:
     Death lies on her like an untimely frost
     Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Nurse
     O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET
     O woful time!
CAPULET
     Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
     Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

FRIAR LAURENCE
     Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
CAPULET
     Ready to go, but never to return.
     O son! the night before thy wedding-day
     Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
     Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
     Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
     My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
     And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
PARIS
     Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
     And doth it give me such a sight as this?
LADY CAPULET
     Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
     Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
     In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
     But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
     But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
     And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
Nurse
     O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
     Most lamentable day, most woful day,
     That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
     O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
     Never was seen so black a day as this:
     O woful day, O woful day!
PARIS
     Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
     Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
     By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
     O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
CAPULET
     Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
     Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
     To murder, murder our solemnity?
     O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
     Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
     And with my child my joys are buried.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
     In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
     Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
     And all the better is it for the maid:
     Your part in her you could not keep from death,
     But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
     The most you sought was her promotion;
     For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
     And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
     Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
     O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
     That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
     She's not well married that lives married long;
     But she's best married that dies married young.
     Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
     On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
     In all her best array bear her to church:
     For though fond nature bids us an lament,
     Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
CAPULET
     All things that we ordained festival,
     Turn from their office to black funeral;
     Our instruments to melancholy bells,
     Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
     Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
     Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
     And all things change them to the contrary.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
     And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
     To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
     The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
     Move them no more by crossing their high will.

PETER
     Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
     ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
First Musician
     Why 'Heart's ease?'
PETER
     O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
     heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
     to comfort me.
First Musician
     Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
PETER
     You will not, then?
First Musician
     No.
PETER
     I will then give it you soundly.
First Musician
     What will you give us?
PETER
     No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
     I will give you the minstrel.
First Musician
     Then I will give you the serving-creature.
PETER
     Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
     your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
     I'll fa you; do you note me?
First Musician
     An you re us and fa us, you note us.
Second Musician
     Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
PETER
     Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
     with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
     me like men:
     'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
     And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
     Then music with her silver sound'--
     why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
     sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
Musician
     Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
PETER
     Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
Second Musician
     I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
PETER
     Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
Third Musician
     Faith, I know not what to say.
PETER
     O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
     for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
     because musicians have no gold for sounding:
     'Then music with her silver sound
     With speedy help doth lend redress.'
     Exit
First Musician

     And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
     Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
     I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
     Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
     to think!--
     And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
     That I revived, and was an emperor.
     Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
     When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
     Enter BALTHASAR, booted
     News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
     Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
     How doth my lady? Is my father well?
     How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
     For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
BALTHASAR
     Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
     Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
     And her immortal part with angels lives.
     I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
     And presently took post to tell it you:
     O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
     Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
ROMEO
     Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
     Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
     And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
BALTHASAR
     I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
     Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
     Some misadventure.
ROMEO
     Tush, thou art deceived:
     Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
     Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
BALTHASAR
     No, my good lord.
ROMEO
     No matter: get thee gone,
     And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
     Exit BALTHASAR
     Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
     Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
     To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
     I do remember an apothecary,--
     And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
     In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
     Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
     Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
     And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
     An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
     Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
     A beggarly account of empty boxes,
     Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
     Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
     Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
     Noting this penury, to myself I said
     'An if a man did need a poison now,
     Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
     Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
     O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
     And this same needy man must sell it me.
     As I remember, this should be the house.
     Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
     What, ho! apothecary!
     Enter Apothecary
Apothecary
     Who calls so loud?
ROMEO
     Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
     Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
     As will disperse itself through all the veins
     That the life-weary taker may fall dead
     And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
     As violently as hasty powder fired
     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Apothecary
     Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
     Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO
     Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
     And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
     Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
     Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
     The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
     The world affords no law to make thee rich;
     Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Apothecary
     My poverty, but not my will, consents.
ROMEO
     I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Apothecary
     Put this in any liquid thing you will,
     And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
     Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
ROMEO
     There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
     Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
     Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
     I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
     Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
     Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
     To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

FRIAR JOHN
     Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
FRIAR LAURENCE
     This same should be the voice of Friar John.
     Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
     Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR JOHN
     Going to find a bare-foot brother out
     One of our order, to associate me,
     Here in this city visiting the sick,
     And finding him, the searchers of the town,
     Suspecting that we both were in a house
     Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
     Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
     So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
FRIAR JOHN
     I could not send it,--here it is again,--
     Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
     So fearful were they of infection.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
     The letter was not nice but full of charge
     Of dear import, and the neglecting it
     May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
     Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
     Unto my cell.
FRIAR JOHN
     Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
     Exit
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Now must I to the monument alone;
     Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
     She will beshrew me much that Romeo
     Hath had no notice of these accidents;
     But I will write again to Mantua,
     And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
     Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS
     Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
     Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
     Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
     Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
     But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
     As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
     Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
PAGE
     [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
     Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
     Retires
PARIS
     Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
     O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
     Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
     Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
     The obsequies that I for thee will keep
     Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
     The Page whistles
     The boy gives warning something doth approach.
     What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
     To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
     What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
     Retires
     Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
ROMEO
     Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
     Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
     See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
     Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
     Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
     And do not interrupt me in my course.
     Why I descend into this bed of death,
     Is partly to behold my lady's face;
     But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
     A precious ring, a ring that I must use
     In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
     But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
     In what I further shall intend to do,
     By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
     And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
     The time and my intents are savage-wild,
     More fierce and more inexorable far
     Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
BALTHASAR
     I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
ROMEO
     So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
     Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
BALTHASAR
     [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
     His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
     Retires
ROMEO
     Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
     Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
     Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
     And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
     Opens the tomb
PARIS
     This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
     That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
     It is supposed, the fair creature died;
     And here is come to do some villanous shame
     To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
     Comes forward
     Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
     Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
     Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
     Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
ROMEO
     I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
     Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
     Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
     Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
     Put not another sin upon my head,
     By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
     By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
     For I come hither arm'd against myself:
     Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
     A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
PARIS
     I do defy thy conjurations,
     And apprehend thee for a felon here.

     Dies
ROMEO
     In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
     Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
     What said my man, when my betossed soul
     Did not attend him as we rode? I think
     He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
     Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
     Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
     To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
     One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
     I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
     A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
     For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
     This vault a feasting presence full of light.
     Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
     Laying PARIS in the tomb
     How oft when men are at the point of death
     Have they been merry! which their keepers call
     A lightning before death: O, how may I
     Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
     Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
     Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
     Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
     Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
     And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
     Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
     O, what more favour can I do to thee,
     Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
     To sunder his that was thine enemy?
     Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
     Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
     That unsubstantial death is amorous,
     And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
     Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
     For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
     And never from this palace of dim night
     Depart again: here, here will I remain
     With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
     Will I set up my everlasting rest,
     And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
     From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
     Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
     The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
     A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
     Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
     The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
     Here's to my love!
     Drinks
     O true apothecary!
     Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
     Dies
     Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a
     lantern, crow, and spade
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
     Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
BALTHASAR
     Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
     What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
     To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
     It burneth in the Capel's monument.
BALTHASAR
     It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
     One that you love.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Who is it?
BALTHASAR
     Romeo.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     How long hath he been there?
BALTHASAR
     Full half an hour.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Go with me to the vault.
BALTHASAR
     I dare not, sir
     My master knows not but I am gone hence;
     And fearfully did menace me with death,
     If I did stay to look on his intents.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
     O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
BALTHASAR
     As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
     I dreamt my master and another fought,
     And that my master slew him.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     Romeo!
     Advances
     Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
     The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
     What mean these masterless and gory swords
     To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
     Enters the tomb
     Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
     And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
     Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
     The lady stirs.
     JULIET wakes
JULIET
     O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
     I do remember well where I should be,
     And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
     Noise within
FRIAR LAURENCE
     I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
     Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
     A greater power than we can contradict
     Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
     Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
     And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
     Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
     Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
     Come, go, good Juliet,
     Noise again
     I dare no longer stay.
JULIET
     Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
     Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
     What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
     Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
     O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
     To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
     Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
     To make die with a restorative.
     Kisses him
     Thy lips are warm.
First Watchman
     [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
JULIET
     Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
     Snatching ROMEO's dagger
     This is thy sheath;
     Stabs herself
     there rust, and let me die.
     Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
     Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
PAGE
     This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
First Watchman
     The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
     Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
     Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
     And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
     Who here hath lain these two days buried.
     Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
     Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
     We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
     But the true ground of all these piteous woes
     We cannot without circumstance descry.
     Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
Second Watchman
     Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
First Watchman
     Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
     Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
Third Watchman
     Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
     We took this mattock and this spade from him,
     As he was coming from this churchyard side.
First Watchman
     A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
     Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
PRINCE
     What misadventure is so early up,
     That calls our person from our morning's rest?
     Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
CAPULET
     What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
LADY CAPULET
     The people in the street cry Romeo,
     Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
     With open outcry toward our monument.
PRINCE
     What fear is this which startles in our ears?
First Watchman
     Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
     And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
     Warm and new kill'd.
PRINCE
     Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
First Watchman
     Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
     With instruments upon them, fit to open
     These dead men's tombs.
CAPULET
     O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
     This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
     Is empty on the back of Montague,--
     And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
LADY CAPULET
     O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
     That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
     Enter MONTAGUE and others
PRINCE
     Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
     To see thy son and heir more early down.
MONTAGUE
     Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
     Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
     What further woe conspires against mine age?
PRINCE
     Look, and thou shalt see.
MONTAGUE
     O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
     To press before thy father to a grave?
PRINCE
     Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
     Till we can clear these ambiguities,
     And know their spring, their head, their
     true descent;
     And then will I be general of your woes,
     And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
     And let mischance be slave to patience.
     Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     I am the greatest, able to do least,
     Yet most suspected, as the time and place
     Doth make against me of this direful murder;
     And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
     Myself condemned and myself excused.
PRINCE
     Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
FRIAR LAURENCE
     I will be brief, for my short date of breath
     Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
     Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
     And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
     I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
     Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
     Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
     For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
     You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
     Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
     To County Paris: then comes she to me,
     And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
     To rid her from this second marriage,
     Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
     Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
     A sleeping potion; which so took effect
     As I intended, for it wrought on her
     The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
     That he should hither come as this dire night,
     To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
     Being the time the potion's force should cease.
     But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
     Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
     Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
     At the prefixed hour of her waking,
     Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
     Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
     Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
     But when I came, some minute ere the time
     Of her awaking, here untimely lay
     The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
     She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
     And bear this work of heaven with patience:
     But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
     And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
     But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
     All this I know; and to the marriage
     Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
     Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
     Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
     Unto the rigour of severest law.
PRINCE
     We still have known thee for a holy man.
     Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
BALTHASAR
     I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
     And then in post he came from Mantua
     To this same place, to this same monument.
     This letter he early bid me give his father,
     And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
     I departed not and left him there.
PRINCE
     Give me the letter; I will look on it.
     Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
     Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
PAGE
     He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
     And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
     Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
     And by and by my master drew on him;
     And then I ran away to call the watch.
PRINCE
     This letter doth make good the friar's words,
     Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
     And here he writes that he did buy a poison
     Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
     Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
     Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
     See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
     That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
     And I for winking at your discords too
     Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
CAPULET
     O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
     This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
     Can I demand.
MONTAGUE
     But I can give thee more:
     For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
     That while Verona by that name is known,
     There shall no figure at such rate be set
     As that of true and faithful Juliet.
CAPULET
     As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
     Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
PRINCE
     A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
     The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
     Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
     Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
     For never was a story of more woe
     Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

     bed, and warm thee.
Hostess
     I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
     third--borough.
     Exit
SLY
     Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
     by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
     and kindly.
     Falls asleep
     Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train
Lord
     Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
     Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
     And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
     Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
     At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
     I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
First Huntsman
     Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
     He cried upon it at the merest loss
     And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
     Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
Lord
     Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
     I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
     But sup them well and look unto them all:
     To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
First Huntsman
     I will, my lord.
Lord
     What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
Second Huntsman
     He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
     This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
Lord
     O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
     Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
     Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
     What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
     Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
     A most delicious banquet by his bed,
     And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
     Would not the beggar then forget himself?
First Huntsman
     Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
Second Huntsman
     It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
Lord
     Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
     Then take him up and manage well the jest:
     Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
     And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
     Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
     And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
     Procure me music ready when he wakes,
     To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
     And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
     And with a low submissive reverence
     Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
     Let one attend him with a silver basin
     Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
     Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
     And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
     Some one be ready with a costly suit
     And ask him what apparel he will wear;
     Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
     And that his lady mourns at his disease:
     Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
     And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
     For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
     This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
     It will be pastime passing excellent,
     If it be husbanded with modesty.
First Huntsman
     My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
     As he shall think by our true diligence
     He is no less than what we say he is.
Lord
     Take him up gently and to bed with him;
     And each one to his office when he wakes.
     Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
     Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
     Exit Servingman
     Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
     Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
     Re-enter Servingman
     How now! who is it?
Servant
     An't please your honour, players
     That offer service to your lordship.
Lord
     Bid them come near.
     Enter Players
     Now, fellows, you are welcome.
Players
     We thank your honour.
Lord
     Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
A Player
     So please your lordship to accept our duty.
Lord
     With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
     Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
     'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
     I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
     Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
A Player
     I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
Lord
     'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
     Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
     The rather for I have some sport in hand
     Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
     There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
     But I am doubtful of your modesties;
     Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
     For yet his honour never heard a play--
     You break into some merry passion
     And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
     If you should smile he grows impatient.
A Player
     Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
     Were he the veriest antic in the world.
Lord
     Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
     And give them friendly welcome every one:
     Let them want nothing that my house affords.
     Exit one with the Players
     Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
     And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
     That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
     And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
     Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
     He bear himself with honourable action,
     Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
     Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
     Such duty to the drunkard let him do
     With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
     And say 'What is't your honour will command,
     Wherein your lady and your humble wife
     May show her duty and make known her love?'
     And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
     And with declining head into his bosom,
     Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
     To see her noble lord restored to health,
     Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
     No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
     And if the boy have not a woman's gift
     To rain a shower of commanded tears,
     An onion will do well for such a shift,
     Which in a napkin being close convey'd
     Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
     See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
     Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
     Exit a Servingman
     I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
     Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
     I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
     And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
     When they do homage to this simple peasant.
     I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
     May well abate the over-merry spleen
     Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house. ****
     Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel, others with
     basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord
SLY
     For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
First Servant
     Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Second Servant
     Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
Third Servant
     What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
SLY
     I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
     'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
     you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
     beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
     have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
     than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
     sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
     toes look through the over-leather.
Lord
     Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
     O, that a mighty man of such descent,
     Of such possessions and so high esteem,
     Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
SLY
     What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
     Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
     pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
     bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
     Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
     she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
     on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
     lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
     bestraught: here's--
Third Servant
     O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
Second Servant
     O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
Lord
     Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
     As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
     O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
     Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
     And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
     Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
     Each in his office ready at thy beck.
     Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
     Music
     And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
     Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
     Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
     On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
     Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
     Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
     Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
     Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
     Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
     Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
     And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
First Servant
     Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
     As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
Second Servant
     Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
     Adonis painted by a running brook,
     And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
     Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
     Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
Lord
     We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
     And how she was beguiled and surprised,
     As lively painted as the deed was done.
Third Servant
     Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
     Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
     And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
     So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
Lord
     Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
     Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
     Than any woman in this waning age.
First Servant
     And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
     Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
     She was the fairest creature in the world;
     And yet she is inferior to none.
SLY
     Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
     Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
     I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
     I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
     Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
     And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
     Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
     And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
Second Servant
     Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
     O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
     O, that once more you knew but what you are!
     These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
     Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
SLY
     These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
     But did I never speak of all that time?
First Servant
     O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
     For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
     Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
     And rail upon the hostess of the house;
     And say you would present her at the leet,
     Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
     Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
SLY
     Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
Third Servant
     Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
     Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
     As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
     And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
     And twenty more such names and men as these
     Which never were nor no man ever saw.
SLY
     Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
ALL
     Amen.
SLY
     I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
     Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants
Page
     How fares my noble lord?
SLY
     Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.
     Where is my wife?
Page
     Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?
SLY
     Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
     My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.
Page
     My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
     I am your wife in all obedience.
SLY
     I know it well. What must I call her?
Lord
     Madam.
SLY
     Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
Lord
     'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
     call ladies.
SLY
     Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
     And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Page
     Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
     Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
SLY
     'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
     Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
Page
     Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
     To pardon me yet for a night or two,
     Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
     For your physicians have expressly charged,
     In peril to incur your former malady,
     That I should yet absent me from your bed:
     I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
SLY
     Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
     tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
     my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
     despite of the flesh and the blood.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
     Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
     For so your doctors hold it very meet,
     Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
     And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
     Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
     And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
     Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
SLY
     Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
     comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
Page
     No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
SLY
     What, household stuff?
Page
     It is a kind of history.
SLY
     Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
     and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.
     Flourish
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. Padua. A public place. ****
     Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
LUCENTIO
     Tranio, since for the great desire I had
     To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
     I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
     The pleasant garden of great Italy;
     And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
     With his good will and thy good company,
     My trusty servant, well approved in all,
     Here let us breathe and haply institute
     A course of learning and ingenious studies.
     Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
     Gave me my being and my father first,
     A merchant of great traffic through the world,
     Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
     Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
     It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
     To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
     And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
     Virtue and that part of philosophy
     Will I apply that treats of happiness
     By virtue specially to be achieved.
     Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
     And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
     A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
     And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
TRANIO
     Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
     I am in all affected as yourself;
     Glad that you thus continue your resolve
     To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
     Only, good master, while we do admire
     This virtue and this moral discipline,
     Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
     Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
     As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
     Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
     And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
     Music and poesy use to quicken you;
     The mathematics and the metaphysics,
     Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
     No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
     In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
LUCENTIO
     Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
     If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
     We could at once put us in readiness,
     And take a lodging fit to entertain
     Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
     But stay a while: what company is this?
TRANIO
     Master, some show to welcome us to town.
     Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO
     and TRANIO stand by
BAPTISTA
     Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
     For how I firmly am resolved you know;
     That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
     Before I have a husband for the elder:
     If either of you both love Katharina,
     Because I know you well and love you well,
     Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
GREMIO
     [Aside] To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
     There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?
KATHARINA
     I pray you, sir, is it your will
     To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
HORTENSIO
     Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
     Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
KATHARINA
     I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
     I wis it is not half way to her heart;
     But if it were, doubt not her care should be
     To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
     And paint your face and use you like a fool.
HORTENSIA
     From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
GREMIO
     And me too, good Lord!
TRANIO
     Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
     That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
LUCENTIO
     But in the other's silence do I see
     Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
     Peace, Tranio!
TRANIO
     Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
BAPTISTA
     Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
     What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
     And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
     For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
KATHARINA
     A pretty peat! it is best
     Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
BIANCA
     Sister, content you in my discontent.
     Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
     My books and instruments shall be my company,
     On them to took and practise by myself.
LUCENTIO
     Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
HORTENSIO
     Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
     Sorry am I that our good will effects
     Bianca's grief.
GREMIO
     Why will you mew her up,
     Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
     And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
BAPTISTA
     Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
     Go in, Bianca:
     Exit BIANCA
     And for I know she taketh most delight
     In music, instruments and poetry,
     Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
     Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
     Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
     Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
     I will be very kind, and liberal
     To mine own children in good bringing up:
     And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
     For I have more to commune with Bianca.
     Exit
KATHARINA
     Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
     shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
     knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
     Exit
GREMIO
     You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
     good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
     so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
     together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
     both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
     sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
     man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
     wish him to her father.
HORTENSIO
     So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
     Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
     parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
     that we may yet again have access to our fair
     mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
     labour and effect one thing specially.
GREMIO
     What's that, I pray?
HORTENSIO
     Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
GREMIO
     A husband! a devil.
HORTENSIO
     I say, a husband.
GREMIO
     I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
     her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
     to be married to hell?
HORTENSIO
     Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
     to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
     fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
     would take her with all faults, and money enough.
GREMIO
     I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
     this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
     every morning.
HORTENSIO
     Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
     apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
     friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
     maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
     to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
     and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
     be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
     How say you, Signior Gremio?
GREMIO
     I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
     horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
     thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
     house of her! Come on.
     Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
TRANIO
     I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
     That love should of a sudden take such hold?
LUCENTIO
     O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
     I never thought it possible or likely;
     But see, while idly I stood looking on,
     I found the effect of love in idleness:
     And now in plainness do confess to thee,
     That art to me as secret and as dear
     As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
     Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
     If I achieve not this young modest girl.
     Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
     Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
TRANIO
     Master, it is no time to chide you now;
     Affection is not rated from the heart:
     If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
     'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
LUCENTIO
     Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
     The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
TRANIO
     Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
     Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
LUCENTIO
     O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
     Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
     That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
     When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
TRANIO
     Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
     Began to scold and raise up such a storm
     That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
LUCENTIO
     Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
     And with her breath she did perfume the air:
     Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
TRANIO
     Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
     I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
     Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
     Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
     That till the father rid his hands of her,
     Master, your love must live a maid at home;
     And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
     Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
LUCENTIO
     Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
     But art thou not advised, he took some care
     To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
TRANIO
     Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
LUCENTIO
     I have it, Tranio.
TRANIO
     Master, for my hand,
     Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
LUCENTIO
     Tell me thine first.
TRANIO
     You will be schoolmaster
     And undertake the teaching of the maid:
     That's your device.
LUCENTIO
     It is: may it be done?
TRANIO
     Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
     And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
     Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
     Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
LUCENTIO
     Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
     We have not yet been seen in any house,
     Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
     For man or master; then it follows thus;
     Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
     Keep house and port and servants as I should:
     I will some other be, some Florentine,
     Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
     'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
     Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
     When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
     But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
TRANIO
     So had you need.
     In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
     And I am tied to be obedient;
     For so your father charged me at our parting,
     'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
     Although I think 'twas in another sense;
     I am content to be Lucentio,
     Because so well I love Lucentio.
LUCENTIO
     Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
     And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
     Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
     Here comes the rogue.
     Enter BIONDELLO
     Sirrah, where have you been?
BIONDELLO
     Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
     Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
     you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
LUCENTIO
     Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
     And therefore frame your manners to the time.
     Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
     Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
     And I for my escape have put on his;
     For in a quarrel since I came ashore
     I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
     Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
     While I make way from hence to save my life:
     You understand me?
BIONDELLO
     I, sir! ne'er a whit.
LUCENTIO
     And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
     Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
BIONDELLO
     The better for him: would I were so too!
TRANIO
     So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
     That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
     But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
     You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
     When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
     But in all places else your master Lucentio.
LUCENTIO
     Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
     thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
     thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
     and weighty.
     Exeunt
     The presenters above speak
First Servant
     My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
SLY
     Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
     comes there any more of it?

     My lord, 'tis but begun.

**** SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house. ****
     Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO
     Verona, for a while I take my leave,
     To see my friends in Padua, but of all
     My best beloved and approved friend,
     Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
     Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
GRUMIO
     Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
     rebused your worship?
PETRUCHIO
     Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
GRUMIO
     Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
     I should knock you here, sir?
PETRUCHIO
     Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
     And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
GRUMIO
     My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
     you first,
     And then I know after who comes by the worst.
PETRUCHIO
     Will it not be?
     Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
     I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
     He wrings him by the ears
GRUMIO
     Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
PETRUCHIO
     Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
     Enter HORTENSIO
HORTENSIO
     How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
     and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
PETRUCHIO
     Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
     'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
HORTENSIO
     'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
     mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
     this quarrel.
GRUMIO
     Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
     if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
     service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
     him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
     use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
     two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
     well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
PETRUCHIO
     A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
     I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
     And could not get him for my heart to do it.
GRUMIO
     Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
     words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
     knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
     now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
PETRUCHIO
     Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
HORTENSIO
     Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
     Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
     Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
     And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
     Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
PETRUCHIO
     Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
     To seek their fortunes farther than at home
     Where small experience grows. But in a few,
     Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
     Antonio, my father, is deceased;
     And I have thrust myself into this maze,
     Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
     Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
     And so am come abroad to see the world.
HORTENSIO
     Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
     And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
     Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
     And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
     And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
     And I'll not wish thee to her.
PETRUCHIO
     Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
     Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
     One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
     As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
     Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
     As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
     As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
     She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
     Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
     As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
     I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
     If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
GRUMIO
     Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
     mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
     a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
     a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
     as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
     so money comes withal.
HORTENSIO
     Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
     I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
     I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
     With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
     Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
     Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
     Is that she is intolerable curst
     And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
     That, were my state far worser than it is,
     I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
PETRUCHIO
     Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
     Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
     For I will board her, though she chide as loud
     As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
HORTENSIO
     Her father is Baptista Minola,
     An affable and courteous gentleman:
     Her name is Katharina Minola,
     Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
PETRUCHIO
     I know her father, though I know not her;
     And he knew my deceased father well.
     I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
     And therefore let me be thus bold with you
     To give you over at this first encounter,
     Unless you will accompany me thither.
GRUMIO
     I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
     O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
     would think scolding would do little good upon him:
     she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
     why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
     his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
     stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
     her face and so disfigure her with it that she
     shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
     You know him not, sir.
HORTENSIO
     Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
     For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
     He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
     His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
     And her withholds from me and other more,
     Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
     Supposing it a thing impossible,
     For those defects I have before rehearsed,
     That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
     Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
     That none shall have access unto Bianca
     Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
GRUMIO
     Katharina the curst!
     A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
HORTENSIO
     Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
     And offer me disguised in sober robes
     To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
     Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
     That so I may, by this device, at least
     Have leave and leisure to make love to her
     And unsuspected court her by herself.
GRUMIO
     Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
     how the young folks lay their heads together!
     Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised
     Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?
HORTENSIO
     Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
     Petruchio, stand by a while.
GRUMIO
     A proper stripling and an amorous!
GREMIO
     O, very well; I have perused the note.
     Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
     All books of love, see that at any hand;
     And see you read no other lectures to her:
     You understand me: over and beside
     Signior Baptista's liberality,
     I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
     And let me have them very well perfumed
     For she is sweeter than perfume itself
     To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
LUCENTIO
     Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
     As for my patron, stand you so assured,
     As firmly as yourself were still in place:
     Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
     Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
GREMIO
     O this learning, what a thing it is!
GRUMIO
     O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
PETRUCHIO
     Peace, sirrah!
HORTENSIO
     Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
GREMIO
     And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
     Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
     I promised to inquire carefully
     About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
     And by good fortune I have lighted well
     On this young man, for learning and behavior
     Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
     And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
HORTENSIO
     'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
     Hath promised me to help me to another,
     A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
     So shall I no whit be behind in duty
     To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
GREMIO
     Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
GRUMIO
     And that his bags shall prove.
HORTENSIO
     Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
     Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
     I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
     Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
     Upon agreement from us to his liking,
     Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
     Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
GREMIO
     So said, so done, is well.
     Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
PETRUCHIO
     I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
     If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
GREMIO
     No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
PETRUCHIO
     Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
     My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
     And I do hope good days and long to see.
GREMIO
     O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
     But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
     You shall have me assisting you in all.
     But will you woo this wild-cat?
PETRUCHIO
     Will I live?
GRUMIO
     Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
PETRUCHIO
     Why came I hither but to that intent?
     Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
     Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
     Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
     Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
     Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
     And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
     Have I not in a pitched battle heard
     Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
     And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
     That gives not half so great a blow to hear
     As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
     Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
GRUMIO
     For he fears none.
GREMIO
     Hortensio, hark:
     This gentleman is happily arrived,
     My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
HORTENSIO
     I promised we would be contributors
     And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
GREMIO
     And so we will, provided that he win her.
GRUMIO
     I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
     Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO
TRANIO
     Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
     Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
     To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
BIONDELLO
     He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
TRANIO
     Even he, Biondello.
GREMIO
     Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--
TRANIO
     Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
PETRUCHIO
     Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
TRANIO
     I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
LUCENTIO
     Well begun, Tranio.
HORTENSIO
     Sir, a word ere you go;
     Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
TRANIO
     And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
GREMIO
     No; if without more words you will get you hence.
TRANIO
     Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
     For me as for you?
GREMIO
     But so is not she.
TRANIO
     For what reason, I beseech you?
GREMIO
     For this reason, if you'll know,
     That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
HORTENSIO
     That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
TRANIO
     Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
     Do me this right; hear me with patience.
     Baptista is a noble gentleman,
     To whom my father is not all unknown;
     And were his daughter fairer than she is,
     She may more suitors have and me for one.
     Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
     Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
     And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
     Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
GREMIO
     What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
LUCENTIO
     Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
PETRUCHIO
     Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
HORTENSIO
     Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
     Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
TRANIO
     No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
     The one as famous for a scolding tongue
     As is the other for beauteous modesty.
PETRUCHIO
     Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
GREMIO
     Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
     And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
PETRUCHIO
     Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
     The younges t daughter whom you hearken for
     Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
     And will not promise her to any man
     Until the elder sister first be wed:
     The younger then is free and not before.
TRANIO
     If it be so, sir, that you are the man
     Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
     And if you break the ice and do this feat,
     Achieve the elder, set the younger free
     For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
     Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
HORTENSIO
     Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
     And since you do profess to be a suitor,
     You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
     To whom we all rest generally beholding.
TRANIO
     Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
     Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
     And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
     And do as adversaries do in law,
     Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
GRUMIO BIONDELLO
     O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
HORTENSIO
     The motion's good indeed and be it so,
     Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house. ****
     Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
BIANCA
     Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
     To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
     That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
     Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
     Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
     Or what you will command me will I do,
     So well I know my duty to my elders.
KATHARINA
     Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
     Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
BIANCA
     Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
     I never yet beheld that special face
     Which I could fancy more than any other.
KATHARINA
     Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
BIANCA
     If you affect him, sister, here I swear
     I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
     him.
KATHARINA
     O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
     You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
BIANCA
     Is it for him you do envy me so?
     Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
     You have but jested with me all this while:
     I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
KATHARINA
     If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
     Strikes her
     Enter BAPTISTA
BAPTISTA
     Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
     Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
     Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
     For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
     Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
     When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
KATHARINA
     Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
     Flies after BIANCA
BAPTISTA
     What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
     Exit BIANCA
KATHARINA
     What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
     She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
     I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
     And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
     Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
     Till I can find occasion of revenge.
     Exit
BAPTISTA
     Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
     But who comes here?
     Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man; PETRUCHIO, with
     HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute
     and books
GREMIO
     Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
BAPTISTA
     Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
     God save you, gentlemen!
PETRUCHIO
     And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
     Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
BAPTISTA
     I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
GREMIO
     You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
PETRUCHIO
     You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
     I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
     That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
     Her affability and bashful modesty,
     Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
     Am bold to show myself a forward guest
     Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
     Of that report which I so oft have heard.
     And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
     I do present you with a man of mine,
     Presenting HORTENSIO
     Cunning in music and the mathematics,
     To instruct her fully in those sciences,
     Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
     Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
     His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
BAPTISTA
     You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
     But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
     She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
PETRUCHIO
     I see you do not mean to part with her,
     Or else you like not of my company.
BAPTISTA
     Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
     Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
PETRUCHIO
     Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
     A man well known throughout all Italy.
BAPTISTA
     I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
GREMIO
     Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
     Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
     Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
PETRUCHIO
     O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
GREMIO
     I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
     wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
     sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
     that have been more kindly beholding to you than
     any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
     Presenting LUCENTIO
     that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
     in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
     in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
     accept his service.
BAPTISTA
     A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
     Welcome, good Cambio.
     To TRANIO
     But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
     may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
TRANIO
     Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
     That, being a stranger in this city here,
     Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
     Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
     Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
     In the preferment of the eldest sister.
     This liberty is all that I request,
     That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
     I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
     And free access and favour as the rest:
     And, toward the education of your daughters,
     I here bestow a simple instrument,
     And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
     If you accept them, then their worth is great.
BAPTISTA
     Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
TRANIO
     Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
BAPTISTA
     A mighty man of Pisa; by report
     I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
     Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
     You shall go see your pupils presently.
     Holla, within!
     Enter a Servant
     Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
     To my daughters; and tell them both,
     These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
     Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following
     We will go walk a little in the orchard,
     And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
     And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
PETRUCHIO
     Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
     And every day I cannot come to woo.
     You knew my father well, and in him me,
     Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
     Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
     Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
     What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
BAPTISTA
     After my death the one half of my lands,
     And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
PETRUCHIO
     And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
     Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
     In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
     Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
     That covenants may be kept on either hand.
BAPTISTA
     Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
     That is, her love; for that is all in all.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
     I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
     And where two raging fires meet together
     They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
     Though little fire grows great with little wind,
     Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
     So I to her and so she yields to me;
     For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
BAPTISTA
     Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
     But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
PETRUCHIO
     Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
     That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
     Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
BAPTISTA
     How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
HORTENSIO
     For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
BAPTISTA
     What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
HORTENSIO
     I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
     Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
BAPTISTA
     Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
HORTENSIO
     Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
     I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
     And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
     When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
     'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
     with them:'
     And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
     And through the instrument my pate made way;
     And there I stood amazed for a while,
     As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
     While she did call me rascal fiddler
     And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
     As had she studied to misuse me so.
PETRUCHIO
     Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
     I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
     O, how I long to have some chat with her!
BAPTISTA
     Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
     Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
     She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
     Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
     Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
PETRUCHIO
     I pray you do.
     Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
     I will attend her here,
     And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
     Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
     She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
     Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
     As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
     Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
     Then I'll commend her volubility,
     And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
     If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
     As though she bid me stay by her a week:
     If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
     When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
     But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
     Enter KATHARINA
     Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
KATHARINA
     Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
     They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
PETRUCHIO
     You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
     And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
     But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
     Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
     For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
     Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
     Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
     Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
     Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
     Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
KATHARINA
     Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
     Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
     You were a moveable.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, what's a moveable?
KATHARINA
     A join'd-stool.
PETRUCHIO
     Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
KATHARINA
     Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
PETRUCHIO
     Women are made to bear, and so are you.
KATHARINA
     No such jade as you, if me you mean.
PETRUCHIO
     Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
     For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
KATHARINA
     Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
     And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
PETRUCHIO
     Should be! should--buzz!
KATHARINA
     Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO
     O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
KATHARINA
     Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO
     Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
KATHARINA
     If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
PETRUCHIO
     My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
KATHARINA
     Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
PETRUCHIO
     Who knows not where a wasp does
     wear his sting? In his tail.
KATHARINA
     In his tongue.
PETRUCHIO
     Whose tongue?
KATHARINA
     Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
PETRUCHIO
     What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
     Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
KATHARINA
     That I'll try.
     She strikes him
PETRUCHIO
     I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
KATHARINA
     So may you lose your arms:
     If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
     And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
PETRUCHIO
     A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
KATHARINA
     What is your crest? a coxcomb?
PETRUCHIO
     A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
KATHARINA
     No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
PETRUCHIO
     Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
KATHARINA
     It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
KATHARINA
     There is, there is.
PETRUCHIO
     Then show it me.
KATHARINA
     Had I a glass, I would.
PETRUCHIO
     What, you mean my face?
KATHARINA
     Well aim'd of such a young one.
PETRUCHIO
     Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
KATHARINA
     Yet you are wither'd.
PETRUCHIO
     'Tis with cares.
KATHARINA
     I care not.
PETRUCHIO
     Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
KATHARINA
     I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
PETRUCHIO
     No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
     'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
     And now I find report a very liar;
     For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
     But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
     Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
     Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
     Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
     But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
     With gentle conference, soft and affable.
     Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
     O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
     Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
     As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
     O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
KATHARINA
     Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
PETRUCHIO
     Did ever Dian so become a grove
     As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
     O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
     And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
KATHARINA
     Where did you study all this goodly speech?
PETRUCHIO
     It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
KATHARINA
     A witty mother! witless else her son.
PETRUCHIO
     Am I not wise?
KATHARINA
     Yes; keep you warm.
PETRUCHIO
     Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
     And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
     Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
     That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
     And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
     Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
     For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
     Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
     Thou must be married to no man but me;
     For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
     And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
     Conformable as other household Kates.
     Here comes your father: never make denial;
     I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
     Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
BAPTISTA
     Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
PETRUCHIO
     How but well, sir? how but well?
     It were impossible I should speed amiss.
BAPTISTA
     Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
KATHARINA
     Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
     You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
     To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
     A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
     That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
PETRUCHIO
     Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
     That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
     If she be curst, it is for policy,
     For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
     She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
     For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
     And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
     And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
     That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
KATHARINA
     I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
GREMIO
     Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
     hang'd first.
TRANIO
     Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
PETRUCHIO
     Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
     If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
     'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
     That she shall still be curst in company.
     I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
     How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
     She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
     She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
     That in a twink she won me to her love.
     O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
     How tame, when men and women are alone,
     A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
     Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
     To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
     Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
     I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
BAPTISTA
     I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
     God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
GREMIO TRANIO
     Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
PETRUCHIO
     Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
     I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
     We will have rings and things and fine array;
     And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
     Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
GREMIO
     Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
BAPTISTA
     Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
     And venture madly on a desperate mart.
TRANIO
     'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
     'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
BAPTISTA
     The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
GREMIO
     No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
     But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
     Now is the day we long have looked for:
     I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
TRANIO
     And I am one that love Bianca more
     Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
GREMIO
     Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
TRANIO
     Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
GREMIO
     But thine doth fry.
     Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
TRANIO
     But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
BAPTISTA
     Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
     'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
     That can assure my daughter greatest dower
     Shall have my Bianca's love.
     Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
GREMIO
     First, as you know, my house within the city
     Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
     Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
     My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
     In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
     In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
     Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
     Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
     Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
     Pewter and brass and all things that belong
     To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
     I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
     Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
     And all things answerable to this portion.
     Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
     And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
     If whilst I live she will be only mine.
TRANIO
     That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
     I am my father's heir and only son:
     If I may have your daughter to my wife,
     I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
     Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
     Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
     Besides two thousand ducats by the year
     Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
     What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
GREMIO
     Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
     My land amounts not to so much in all:
     That she shall have; besides an argosy
     That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
     What, have I choked you with an argosy?
TRANIO
     Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
     Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
     And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
     And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
GREMIO
     Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
     And she can have no more than all I have:
     If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
TRANIO
     Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
     By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
BAPTISTA
     I must confess your offer is the best;
     And, let your father make her the assurance,
     She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
     if you should die before him, where's her dower?
TRANIO
     That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
GREMIO
     And may not young men die, as well as old?
BAPTISTA
     Well, gentlemen,
     I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
     My daughter Katharina is to be married:
     Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
     Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
     If not, Signior Gremio:
     And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
GREMIO
     Adieu, good neighbour.
     Exit BAPTISTA
     Now I fear thee not:
     Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
     To give thee all, and in his waning age
     Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
     An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
     Exit
TRANIO
     A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
     Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
     'Tis in my head to do my master good:
     I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
     Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
     And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
     Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
     A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
     Exit
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house. ****
     Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA
LUCENTIO
     Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
     Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
     Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
HORTENSIO
     But, wrangling pedant, this is
     The patroness of heavenly harmony:
     Then give me leave to have prerogative;
     And when in music we have spent an hour,
     Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
LUCENTIO
     Preposterous ass, that never read so far
     To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
     Was it not to refresh the mind of man
     After his studies or his usual pain?
     Then give me leave to read philosophy,
     And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
HORTENSIO
     Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
BIANCA
     Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
     To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
     I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
     I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
     But learn my lessons as I please myself.
     And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
     Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
     His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
HORTENSIO
     You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
LUCENTIO
     That will be never: tune your instrument.
BIANCA
     Where left we last?
LUCENTIO
     Here, madam:
     'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
     Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
BIANCA
     Construe them.
LUCENTIO
     'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
     Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
     'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
     'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
     a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
     bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
     beguile the old pantaloon.
HORTENSIO
     Madam, my instrument's in tune.
BIANCA
     Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
LUCENTIO
     Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
BIANCA
     Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
     Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
     trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
     he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
     despair not.
HORTENSIO
     Madam, 'tis now in tune.
LUCENTIO
     All but the base.
HORTENSIO
     The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
     Aside
     How fiery and forward our pedant is!
     Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
     Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
BIANCA
     In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
LUCENTIO
     Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
     Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
BIANCA
     I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
     I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
     But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
     Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
     That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
HORTENSIO
     You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
     My lessons make no music in three parts.
LUCENTIO
     Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
     Aside
     And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
     Our fine musician groweth amorous.
HORTENSIO
     Madam, before you touch the instrument,
     To learn the order of my fingering,
     I must begin with rudiments of art;
     To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
     More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
     Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
     And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
BIANCA
     Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
HORTENSIO
     Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
BIANCA
     [Reads] ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
     'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;
     'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
     'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
     'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
     'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
     Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
     Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
     To change true rules for old inventions.
     Enter a Servant
Servant
     Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
     And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
     You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
BIANCA
     Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
     Exeunt BIANCA and Servant
LUCENTIO
     Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
     Exit
HORTENSIO
     But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
     Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
     Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
     To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
     Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
     Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house. ****
     Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and
     others, attendants
BAPTISTA
     [To TRANIO] Signior Lucentio, this is the
     'pointed day.
     That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
     And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
     What will be said? what mockery will it be,
     To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
     To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
     What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
KATHARINA
     No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
     To give my hand opposed against my heart
     Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
     Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
     I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
     Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
     And, to be noted for a merry man,
     He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
     Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
     Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
     Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
     And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
     If it would please him come and marry her!'
TRANIO
     Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
     Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
     Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
     Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
     Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
KATHARINA
     Would Katharina had never seen him though!
     Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
BAPTISTA
     Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
     For such an injury would vex a very saint,
     Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
     Enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO
     Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
     you never heard of!
BAPTISTA
     Is it new and old too? how may that be?
BIONDELLO
     Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
BAPTISTA
     Is he come?
BIONDELLO
     Why, no, sir.
BAPTISTA
     What then?
BIONDELLO
     He is coming.
BAPTISTA
     When will he be here?
BIONDELLO
     When he stands where I am and sees you there.
TRANIO
     But say, what to thine old news?
BIONDELLO
     Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
     jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
     of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
     another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
     town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
     with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
     old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
     besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
     in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
     with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
     spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
     stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
     bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
     near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
     and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
     restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
     often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
     six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
     which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
     in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
BAPTISTA
     Who comes with him?
BIONDELLO
     O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
     like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
     kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
     and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
     fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
     very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
     footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
TRANIO
     'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
     Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
BAPTISTA
     I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
BIONDELLO
     Why, sir, he comes not.
BAPTISTA
     Didst thou not say he comes?
BIONDELLO
     Who? that Petruchio came?
BAPTISTA
     Ay, that Petruchio came.
BIONDELLO
     No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
BAPTISTA
     Why, that's all one.
BIONDELLO
     Nay, by Saint Jamy,
     I hold you a penny,
     A horse and a man
     Is more than one,
     And yet not many.
     Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO
     Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
BAPTISTA
     You are welcome, sir.
PETRUCHIO
     And yet I come not well.
BAPTISTA
     And yet you halt not.
TRANIO
     Not so well apparell'd
     As I wish you were.
PETRUCHIO
     Were it better, I should rush in thus.
     But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
     How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
     And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
     As if they saw some wondrous monument,
     Some comet or unusual prodigy?
BAPTISTA
     Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
     First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
     Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
     Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
     An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
TRANIO
     And tells us, what occasion of import
     Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
     And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
PETRUCHIO
     Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
     Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
     Though in some part enforced to digress;
     Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
     As you shall well be satisfied withal.
     But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
     The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
TRANIO
     See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
     Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
PETRUCHIO
     Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
BAPTISTA
     But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
PETRUCHIO
     Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
     To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
     Could I repair what she will wear in me,
     As I can change these poor accoutrements,
     'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
     But what a fool am I to chat with you,
     When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
     And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
     Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
TRANIO
     He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
     We will persuade him, be it possible,
     To put on better ere he go to church.
BAPTISTA
     I'll after him, and see the event of this.
     Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants
TRANIO
     But to her love concerneth us to add
     Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
     As I before unparted to your worship,
     I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
     It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
     And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
     And make assurance here in Padua
     Of greater sums than I have promised.
     So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
     And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
LUCENTIO
     Were it not that my fellow-school-master
     Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
     'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
     Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
     I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
TRANIO
     That by degrees we mean to look into,
     And watch our vantage in this business:
     We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
     The narrow-prying father, Minola,
     The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
     All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
     Re-enter GREMIO
     Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
GREMIO
     As willingly as e'er I came from school.
TRANIO
     And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
GREMIO
     A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
     A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
TRANIO
     Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
GREMIO
     Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
TRANIO
     Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
GREMIO
     Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
     I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
     Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
     'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
     That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
     And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
     The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
     That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
     'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
TRANIO
     What said the wench when he rose again?
GREMIO
     Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
     As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
     But after many ceremonies done,
     He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
     He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
     After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
     And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
     Having no other reason
     But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
     And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
     This done, he took the bride about the neck
     And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
     That at the parting all the church did echo:
     And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
     And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
     Such a mad marriage never was before:
     Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
     Music
     Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO,
     and Train
PETRUCHIO
     Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
     I know you think to dine with me to-day,
     And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
     But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
     And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
BAPTISTA
     Is't possible you will away to-night?
PETRUCHIO
     I must away to-day, before night come:
     Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
     You would entreat me rather go than stay.
     And, honest company, I thank you all,
     That have beheld me give away myself
     To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
     Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
     For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
TRANIO
     Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
PETRUCHIO
     It may not be.
GREMIO
     Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO
     It cannot be.
KATHARINA
     Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO
     I am content.
KATHARINA
     Are you content to stay?
PETRUCHIO
     I am content you shall entreat me stay;
     But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
KATHARINA
     Now, if you love me, stay.
PETRUCHIO
     Grumio, my horse.
GRUMIO
     Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
KATHARINA
     Nay, then,
     Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
     No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
     The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
     You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
     For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
     'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
     That take it on you at the first so roundly.
PETRUCHIO
     O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
KATHARINA
     I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
     Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
GREMIO
     Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
KATARINA
     Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
     I see a woman may be made a fool,
     If she had not a spirit to resist.
PETRUCHIO
     They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
     Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
     Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
     Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
     Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
     But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
     Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
     I will be master of what is mine own:
     She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
     My household stuff, my field, my barn,
     My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
     And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
     I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
     That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
     Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
     Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
     Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
     thee, Kate:
     I'll buckler thee against a million.
     Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO
BAPTISTA
     Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
GREMIO
     Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
TRANIO
     Of all mad matches never was the like.
LUCENTIO
     Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
BIANCA
     That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
GREMIO
     I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
BAPTISTA
     Neighbours and friends, though bride and
     bridegroom wants
     For to supply the places at the table,
     You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
     Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
     And let Bianca take her sister's room.
TRANIO
     Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
BAPTISTA
     She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
     Exeunt
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house. ****
     Enter GRUMIO
GRUMIO
     Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
     all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
     man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
     before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
     warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
     hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
     tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
     belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
     I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
     considering the weather, a taller man than I will
     take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.
     Enter CURTIS
CURTIS
     Who is that calls so coldly?
GRUMIO
     A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
     from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
     but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
CURTIS
     Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
GRUMIO
     O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
     on no water.
CURTIS
     Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
GRUMIO
     She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
     knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
     hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
     myself, fellow Curtis.
CURTIS
     Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
GRUMIO
     Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
     so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
     fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
     whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
     feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
CURTIS
     I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
GRUMIO
     A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
     therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
     my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
CURTIS
     There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
GRUMIO
     Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
     will thaw.
CURTIS
     Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
GRUMIO
     Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
     Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
     trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
     serving-men in their new fustian, their white
     stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
     Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
     the carpets laid, and every thing in order?
CURTIS
     All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
GRUMIO
     First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
     mistress fallen out.
CURTIS
     How?
GRUMIO
     Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
     hangs a tale.
CURTIS
     Let's ha't, good Grumio.
GRUMIO
     Lend thine ear.
CURTIS
     Here.
GRUMIO
     There.
     Strikes him
CURTIS
     This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
GRUMIO
     And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
     cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
     listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
     foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
CURTIS
     Both of one horse?
GRUMIO
     What's that to thee?
CURTIS
     Why, a horse.
GRUMIO
     Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
     thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
     under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
     miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
     with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
     her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
     to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
     that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
     horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
     lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
     which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
     unexperienced to thy grave.
CURTIS
     By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
GRUMIO
     Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
     find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
     Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
     Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
     sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
     garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
     with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
     of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
     hands. Are they all ready?
CURTIS
     They are.
GRUMIO
     Call them forth.
CURTIS
     Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
     countenance my mistress.
GRUMIO
     Why, she hath a face of her own.
CURTIS
     Who knows not that?
GRUMIO
     Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
     countenance her.
CURTIS
     I call them forth to credit her.
GRUMIO
     Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
     Enter four or five Serving-men
NATHANIEL
     Welcome home, Grumio!
PHILIP
     How now, Grumio!
JOSEPH
     What, Grumio!
NICHOLAS
     Fellow Grumio!
NATHANIEL
     How now, old lad?
GRUMIO
     Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
     you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
     companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
NATHANIEL
     All things is ready. How near is our master?
GRUMIO
     E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
     not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
     Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
PETRUCHIO
     Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
     To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
     Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
     ALL SERVING-MEN Here, here, sir; here, sir.
PETRUCHIO
     Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
     You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
     What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
     Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
GRUMIO
     Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
PETRUCHIO
     You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
     Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
     And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
GRUMIO
     Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
     And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
     There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
     And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
     There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
     The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
     Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
PETRUCHIO
     Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
     Exeunt Servants
     Singing
     Where is the life that late I led--
     Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
     Sound, sound, sound, sound!
     Re-enter Servants with supper
     Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
     Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
     Sings
     It was the friar of orders grey,
     As he forth walked on his way:--
     Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
     Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
     Strikes him
     Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
     Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
     And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
     One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
     Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
     Enter one with water
     Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
     You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
     Strikes him
KATHARINA
     Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
PETRUCHIO
     A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
     Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
     Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
     What's this? mutton?
First Servant
     Ay.
PETRUCHIO
     Who brought it?
PETER
     I.
PETRUCHIO
     'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
     What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
     How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
     And serve it thus to me that love it not?
     Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
     Throws the meat, & c. about the stage
     You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
     What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
KATHARINA
     I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
     The meat was well, if you were so contented.
PETRUCHIO
     I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
     And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
     For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
     And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
     Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
     Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
     Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
     And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
     Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

     Peter, didst ever see the like?

     He kills her in her own humour.
     Re-enter CURTIS
GRUMIO
     Where is he?
CURTIS
     In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
     And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
     Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
     And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
     Away, away! for he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO
     Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
     And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
     My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
     And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
     For then she never looks upon her lure.
     Another way I have to man my haggard,
     To make her come and know her keeper's call,
     That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
     That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
     She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
     Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
     As with the meat, some undeserved fault
     I'll find about the making of the bed;
     And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
     This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
     Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
     That all is done in reverend care of her;
     And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
     And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
     And with the clamour keep her still awake.
     This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
     And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
     He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
     Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

     Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO
TRANIO
     Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
     Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
     I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
HORTENSIO
     Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
     Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
     Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO
LUCENTIO
     Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
BIANCA
     What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
LUCENTIO
     I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
BIANCA
     And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
LUCENTIO
     While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
HORTENSIO
     Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
     You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
     Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
TRANIO
     O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
     I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
HORTENSIO
     Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
     Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
     But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
     For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
     And makes a god of such a cullion:
     Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
TRANIO
     Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
     Of your entire affection to Bianca;
     And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
     I will with you, if you be so contented,
     Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
HORTENSIO
     See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
     Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
     Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
     As one unworthy all the former favours
     That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
TRANIO
     And here I take the unfeigned oath,
     Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
     Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
HORTENSIO
     Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
     For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
     I will be married to a wealthy widow,
     Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
     As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
     And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
     Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
     Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
     In resolution as I swore before.
     Exit
TRANIO
     Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
     As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
     Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
     And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
BIANCA
     Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
TRANIO
     Mistress, we have.
LUCENTIO
     Then we are rid of Licio.
TRANIO
     I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
     That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
BIANCA
     God give him joy!
TRANIO
     Ay, and he'll tame her.
BIANCA
     He says so, Tranio.
TRANIO
     Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
BIANCA
     The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
TRANIO
     Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
     That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
     To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
     Enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO
     O master, master, I have watch'd so long
     That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
     An ancient angel coming down the hill,
     Will serve the turn.
TRANIO
     What is he, Biondello?
BIONDELLO
     Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
     I know not what; but format in apparel,
     In gait and countenance surely like a father.
LUCENTIO
     And what of him, Tranio?
TRANIO
     If he be credulous and trust my tale,
     I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
     And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
     As if he were the right Vincentio
     Take in your love, and then let me alone.
     Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
     Enter a Pedant
Pedant
     God save you, sir!
TRANIO
     And you, sir! you are welcome.
     Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
Pedant
     Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
     But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
     And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
TRANIO
     What countryman, I pray?
Pedant
     Of Mantua.
TRANIO
     Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
     And come to Padua, careless of your life?
Pedant
     My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
TRANIO
     'Tis death for any one in Mantua
     To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
     Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
     For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
     Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
     'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
     You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
Pedant
     Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
     For I have bills for money by exchange
     From Florence and must here deliver them.
TRANIO
     Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
     This will I do, and this I will advise you:
     First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
Pedant
     Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
     Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
TRANIO
     Among them know you one Vincentio?
Pedant
     I know him not, but I have heard of him;
     A merchant of incomparable wealth.
TRANIO
     He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
     In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
BIONDELLO
     [Aside] As much as an apple doth an oyster,
     and all one.
TRANIO
     To save your life in this extremity,
     This favour will I do you for his sake;
     And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
     That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
     His name and credit shall you undertake,
     And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
     Look that you take upon you as you should;
     You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
     Till you have done your business in the city:
     If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
Pedant
     O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
     The patron of my life and liberty.
TRANIO
     Then go with me to make the matter good.
     This, by the way, I let you understand;
     my father is here look'd for every day,
     To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
     'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
     In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
     Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO'S house. ****
     Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO
GRUMIO
     No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
KATHARINA
     The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
     What, did he marry me to famish me?
     Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
     Upon entreaty have a present aims;
     If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
     But I, who never knew how to entreat,
     Nor never needed that I should entreat,
     Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
     With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
     And that which spites me more than all these wants,
     He does it under name of perfect love;
     As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
     'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
     I prithee go and get me some repast;
     I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
GRUMIO
     What say you to a neat's foot?
KATHARINA
     'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
GRUMIO
     I fear it is too choleric a meat.
     How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
KATHARINA
     I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
GRUMIO
     I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
     What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
KATHARINA
     A dish that I do love to feed upon.
GRUMIO
     Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
KATHARINA
     Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
GRUMIO
     Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
     Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
KATHARINA
     Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
GRUMIO
     Why then, the mustard without the beef.
KATHARINA
     Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
     Beats him
     That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
     Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
     That triumph thus upon my misery!
     Go, get thee gone, I say.
     Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat
PETRUCHIO
     How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
HORTENSIO
     Mistress, what cheer?
KATHARINA
     Faith, as cold as can be.
PETRUCHIO
     Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
     Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
     To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
     I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
     What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
     And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
     Here, take away this dish.
KATHARINA
     I pray you, let it stand.
PETRUCHIO
     The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
     And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
KATHARINA
     I thank you, sir.
HORTENSIO
     Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
     Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
PETRUCHIO
     [Aside] Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
     Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
     Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
     Will we return unto thy father's house
     And revel it as bravely as the best,
     With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
     With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;
     With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
     With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
     What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
     To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
     Enter Tailor
     Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
     Lay forth the gown.
     Enter Haberdasher
     What news with you, sir?
Haberdasher
     Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
     A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
     Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
     A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
     Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
KATHARINA
     I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
     And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
PETRUCHIO
     When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
     And not till then.
HORTENSIO
     [Aside] That will not be in haste.
KATHARINA
     Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
     And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
     Your betters have endured me say my mind,
     And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
     My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
     Or else my heart concealing it will break,
     And rather than it shall, I will be free
     Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
     A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
     I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
KATHARINA
     Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
     And it I will have, or I will have none.
     Exit Haberdasher
PETRUCHIO
     Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
     O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
     What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
     What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
     Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
     Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
     Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
HORTENSIO
     [Aside] I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
Tailor
     You bid me make it orderly and well,
     According to the fashion and the time.
PETRUCHIO
     Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
     I did not bid you mar it to the time.
     Go, hop me over every kennel home,
     For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
     I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
KATHARINA
     I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
     More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
     Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
Tailor
     She says your worship means to make
     a puppet of her.
PETRUCHIO
     O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
     thou thimble,
     Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
     Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
     Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
     Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
     Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
     As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
     I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
Tailor
     Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
     Just as my master had direction:
     Grumio gave order how it should be done.
GRUMIO
     I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
Tailor
     But how did you desire it should be made?
GRUMIO
     Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
Tailor
     But did you not request to have it cut?
GRUMIO
     Thou hast faced many things.
Tailor
     I have.
GRUMIO
     Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
     me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
     thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
     not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
Tailor
     Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
PETRUCHIO
     Read it.
GRUMIO
     The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
Tailor
     [Reads] 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'
GRUMIO
     Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
     the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
     of brown thread: I said a gown.
PETRUCHIO
     Proceed.
Tailor
     [Reads] 'With a small compassed cape:'
GRUMIO
     I confess the cape.
Tailor
     [Reads] 'With a trunk sleeve:'
GRUMIO
     I confess two sleeves.
Tailor
     [Reads] 'The sleeves curiously cut.'
PETRUCHIO
     Ay, there's the villany.
GRUMIO
     Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
     I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
     sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
     though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
Tailor
     This is true that I say: an I had thee
     in place where, thou shouldst know it.
GRUMIO
     I am for thee straight: take thou the
     bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
HORTENSIO
     God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.
PETRUCHIO
     Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
GRUMIO
     You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
PETRUCHIO
     Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
GRUMIO
     Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
     gown for thy master's use!
PETRUCHIO
     Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
GRUMIO
     O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
     Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
     O, fie, fie, fie!
PETRUCHIO
     [Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
     Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
HORTENSIO
     Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
     Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
     Away! I say; commend me to thy master.
     Exit Tailor
PETRUCHIO
     Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
     Even in these honest mean habiliments:
     Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
     For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
     And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
     So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
     What is the jay more precious than the lark,
     Because his fathers are more beautiful?
     Or is the adder better than the eel,
     Because his painted skin contents the eye?
     O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
     For this poor furniture and mean array.
     if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
     And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
     To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
     Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
     And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
     There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
     Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
     And well we may come there by dinner-time.
KATHARINA
     I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
     And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
PETRUCHIO
     It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
     Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
     You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
     I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
     It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
HORTENSIO
     [Aside] Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house. ****
     Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO
TRANIO
     Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
Pedant
     Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
     Signior Baptista may remember me,
     Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
     Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
TRANIO
     'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
     With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
Pedant
     I warrant you.
     Enter BIONDELLO
     But, sir, here comes your boy;
     'Twere good he were school'd.
TRANIO
     Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
     Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
     Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
BIONDELLO
     Tut, fear not me.
TRANIO
     But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
BIONDELLO
     I told him that your father was at Venice,
     And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
TRANIO
     Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
     Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
     Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO
     Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
     To the Pedant
     Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
     I pray you stand good father to me now,
     Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
Pedant
     Soft son!
     Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
     To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
     Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
     Of love between your daughter and himself:
     And, for the good report I hear of you
     And for the love he beareth to your daughter
     And she to him, to stay him not too long,
     I am content, in a good father's care,
     To have him match'd; and if you please to like
     No worse than I, upon some agreement
     Me shall you find ready and willing
     With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
     For curious I cannot be with you,
     Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
BAPTISTA
     Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
     Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
     Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
     Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
     Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
     And therefore, if you say no more than this,
     That like a father you will deal with him
     And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
     The match is made, and all is done:
     Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
TRANIO
     I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
     We be affied and such assurance ta'en
     As shall with either part's agreement stand?
BAPTISTA
     Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
     Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
     Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
     And happily we might be interrupted.
TRANIO
     Then at my lodging, an it like you:
     There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
     We'll pass the business privately and well.
     Send for your daughter by your servant here:
     My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
     The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
     You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
BAPTISTA
     It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
     And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
     And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
     Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
     And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
BIONDELLO
     I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
TRANIO
     Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
     Exit BIONDELLO
     Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
     Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
     Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
BAPTISTA
     I follow you.
     Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA
     Re-enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO
     Cambio!
LUCENTIO
     What sayest thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO
     You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
LUCENTIO
     Biondello, what of that?
BIONDELLO
     Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
     expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
LUCENTIO
     I pray thee, moralize them.
BIONDELLO
     Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
     deceiving father of a deceitful son.
LUCENTIO
     And what of him?
BIONDELLO
     His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
LUCENTIO
     And then?
BIONDELLO
     The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
     command at all hours.
LUCENTIO
     And what of all this?
BIONDELLO
     I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
     counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
     'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
     church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
     honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
     I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
     ever and a day.
LUCENTIO
     Hearest thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO
     I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
     afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
     stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
     sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
     Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
     you come with your appendix.
     Exit
LUCENTIO
     I may, and will, if she be so contented:
     She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
     Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
     It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
     Exit
**** SCENE V. A public road. ****
     Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants
PETRUCHIO
     Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
     Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
KATHARINA
     The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
PETRUCHIO
     I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KATHARINA
     I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRUCHIO
     Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
     It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
     Or ere I journey to your father's house.
     Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
     Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
HORTENSIO
     Say as he says, or we shall never go.
KATHARINA
     Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
     And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
     An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
     Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
PETRUCHIO
     I say it is the moon.
KATHARINA
     I know it is the moon.
PETRUCHIO
     Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
KATHARINA
     Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
     But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
     And the moon changes even as your mind.
     What you will have it named, even that it is;
     And so it shall be so for Katharina.
HORTENSIO
     Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
PETRUCHIO
     Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
     And not unluckily against the bias.
     But, soft! company is coming here.
     Enter VINCENTIO
     To VINCENTIO
     Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
     Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
     Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
     Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
     What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
     As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
     Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
     Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
HORTENSIO
     A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
KATHARINA
     Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
     Whither away, or where is thy abode?
     Happy the parents of so fair a child;
     Happier the man, whom favourable stars
     Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
PETRUCHIO
     Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
     This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
     And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
KATHARINA
     Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
     That have been so bedazzled with the sun
     That everything I look on seemeth green:
     Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
     Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
PETRUCHIO
     Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
     Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
     We shall be joyful of thy company.
VINCENTIO
     Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
     That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
     My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
     And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
     A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
PETRUCHIO
     What is his name?
VINCENTIO
     Lucentio, gentle sir.
PETRUCHIO
     Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
     And now by law, as well as reverend age,
     I may entitle thee my loving father:
     The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
     Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
     Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
     Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
     Beside, so qualified as may beseem
     The spouse of any noble gentleman.
     Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
     And wander we to see thy honest son,
     Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
VINCENTIO
     But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
     Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
     Upon the company you overtake?
HORTENSIO
     I do assure thee, father, so it is.
PETRUCHIO
     Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
     For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
     Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
HORTENSIO
     Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
     Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
     Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
     Exit
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house. ****
     GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA
BIONDELLO
     Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
LUCENTIO
     I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
     at home; therefore leave us.
BIONDELLO
     Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
     then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
     Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO
GREMIO
     I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
     Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants
PETRUCHIO
     Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
     My father's bears more toward the market-place;
     Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
VINCENTIO
     You shall not choose but drink before you go:
     I think I shall command your welcome here,
     And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
     Knocks
GREMIO
     They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
     Pedant looks out of the window
Pedant
     What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
VINCENTIO
     Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
Pedant
     He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
VINCENTIO
     What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
     make merry withal?
Pedant
     Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
     need none, so long as I live.
PETRUCHIO
     Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
     Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
     I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
     come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
Pedant
     Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
     looking out at the window.
VINCENTIO
     Art thou his father?
Pedant
     Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
PETRUCHIO
     [To VINCENTIO] Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
     is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
Pedant
     Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
     cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
     Re-enter BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO
     I have seen them in the church together: God send
     'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
     master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
VINCENTIO
     [Seeing BIONDELLO]
     Come hither, crack-hemp.
BIONDELLO
     Hope I may choose, sir.
VINCENTIO
     Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
BIONDELLO
     Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
     never saw you before in all my life.
VINCENTIO
     What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
     thy master's father, Vincentio?
BIONDELLO
     What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
     see where he looks out of the window.
VINCENTIO
     Is't so, indeed.
     Beats BIONDELLO
BIONDELLO
     Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
     Exit
Pedant
     Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
     Exit from above
PETRUCHIO
     Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
     this controversy.
     They retire
     Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants
TRANIO
     Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
VINCENTIO
     What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
     gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
     hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
     am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
     husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
     the university.
TRANIO
     How now! what's the matter?
BAPTISTA
     What, is the man lunatic?
TRANIO
     Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
     habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
     what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
     thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
VINCENTIO
     Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
BAPTISTA
     You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
     you think is his name?
VINCENTIO
     His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
     him up ever since he was three years old, and his
     name is Tranio.
Pedant
     Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
     mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
VINCENTIO
     Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
     on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
     son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
TRANIO
     Call forth an officer.
     Enter one with an Officer
     Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
     I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
VINCENTIO
     Carry me to the gaol!
GREMIO
     Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
BAPTISTA
     Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
GREMIO
     Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
     cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
     is the right Vincentio.
Pedant
     Swear, if thou darest.
GREMIO
     Nay, I dare not swear it.
TRANIO
     Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
GREMIO
     Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
BAPTISTA
     Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
VINCENTIO
     Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
     monstrous villain!
     Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
BIONDELLO
     O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
     forswear him, or else we are all undone.
LUCENTIO
     [Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father.
VINCENTIO
     Lives my sweet son?
     Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be
BIANCA
     Pardon, dear father.
BAPTISTA
     How hast thou offended?
     Where is Lucentio?
LUCENTIO
     Here's Lucentio,
     Right son to the right Vincentio;
     That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
     While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
GREMIO
     Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
VINCENTIO
     Where is that damned villain Tranio,
     That faced and braved me in this matter so?
BAPTISTA
     Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
BIANCA
     Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
LUCENTIO
     Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
     Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
     While he did bear my countenance in the town;
     And happily I have arrived at the last
     Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
     What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
     Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
VINCENTIO
     I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
     me to the gaol.
BAPTISTA
     But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
     without asking my good will?
VINCENTIO
     Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
     I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
     Exit
BAPTISTA
     And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
     Exit
LUCENTIO
     Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
     Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
GREMIO
     My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
     Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
     Exit
KATHARINA
     Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
PETRUCHIO
     First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
KATHARINA
     What, in the midst of the street?
PETRUCHIO
     What, art thou ashamed of me?
KATHARINA
     No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
KATHARINA
     Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
PETRUCHIO
     Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
     Better once than never, for never too late.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house. ****
     Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant, LUCENTIO, BIANCA,
     PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and
     GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet
LUCENTIO
     At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
     And time it is, when raging war is done,
     To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
     My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
     While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
     Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
     And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
     Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
     My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
     After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
     For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
PETRUCHIO
     Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
BAPTISTA
     Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
PETRUCHIO
     Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
HORTENSIO
     For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
PETRUCHIO
     Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Widow
     Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
PETRUCHIO
     You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
     I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
Widow
     He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
PETRUCHIO
     Roundly replied.
KATHARINA
     Mistress, how mean you that?
Widow
     Thus I conceive by him.
PETRUCHIO
     Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
HORTENSIO
     My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
PETRUCHIO
     Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
KATHARINA
     'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
     I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
Widow
     Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
     Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
     And now you know my meaning,
KATHARINA
     A very mean meaning.
Widow
     Right, I mean you.
KATHARINA
     And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
PETRUCHIO
     To her, Kate!
HORTENSIO
     To her, widow!
PETRUCHIO
     A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
HORTENSIO
     That's my office.
PETRUCHIO
     Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
     Drinks to HORTENSIO
BAPTISTA
     How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
GREMIO
     Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BIANCA
     Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
     Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
VINCENTIO
     Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
BIANCA
     Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
PETRUCHIO
     Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
     Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
BIANCA
     Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
     And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
     You are welcome all.
     Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow
PETRUCHIO
     She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
     This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
     Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
TRANIO
     O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
     Which runs himself and catches for his master.
PETRUCHIO
     A good swift simile, but something currish.
TRANIO
     'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
     'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
BAPTISTA
     O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
LUCENTIO
     I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
HORTENSIO
     Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
PETRUCHIO
     A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
     And, as the jest did glance away from me,
     'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
BAPTISTA
     Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
     I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
PETRUCHIO
     Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
     Let's each one send unto his wife;
     And he whose wife is most obedient
     To come at first when he doth send for her,
     Shall win the wager which we will propose.
HORTENSIO
     Content. What is the wager?
LUCENTIO
     Twenty crowns.
PETRUCHIO
     Twenty crowns!
     I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
     But twenty times so much upon my wife.
LUCENTIO
     A hundred then.
HORTENSIO
     Content.
PETRUCHIO
     A match! 'tis done.
HORTENSIO
     Who shall begin?
LUCENTIO
     That will I.
     Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
BIONDELLO
     I go.
     Exit
BAPTISTA
     Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
LUCENTIO
     I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
     Re-enter BIONDELLO
     How now! what news?
BIONDELLO
     Sir, my mistress sends you word
     That she is busy and she cannot come.
PETRUCHIO
     How! she is busy and she cannot come!
     Is that an answer?
GREMIO
     Ay, and a kind one too:
     Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
PETRUCHIO
     I hope better.
HORTENSIO
     Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
     To come to me forthwith.
     Exit BIONDELLO
PETRUCHIO
     O, ho! entreat her!
     Nay, then she must needs come.
HORTENSIO
     I am afraid, sir,
     Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
     Re-enter BIONDELLO
     Now, where's my wife?
BIONDELLO
     She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
     She will not come: she bids you come to her.
PETRUCHIO
     Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
     Intolerable, not to be endured!
     Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
     Say, I command her to come to me.
     Exit GRUMIO
HORTENSIO
     I know her answer.
PETRUCHIO
     What?
HORTENSIO
     She will not.
PETRUCHIO
     The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
BAPTISTA
     Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
     Re-enter KATARINA
KATHARINA
     What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
PETRUCHIO
     Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
KATHARINA
     They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
PETRUCHIO
     Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
     Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
     Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
     Exit KATHARINA
LUCENTIO
     Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
HORTENSIO
     And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
PETRUCHIO
     Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
     And awful rule and right supremacy;
     And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
BAPTISTA
     Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
     The wager thou hast won; and I will add
     Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
     Another dowry to another daughter,
     For she is changed, as she had never been.
PETRUCHIO
     Nay, I will win my wager better yet
     And show more sign of her obedience,
     Her new-built virtue and obedience.
     See where she comes and brings your froward wives
     As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
     Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow
     Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
     Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
Widow
     Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
     Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
BIANCA
     Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
LUCENTIO
     I would your duty were as foolish too:
     The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
     Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
BIANCA
     The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
PETRUCHIO
     Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
     What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Widow
     Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
PETRUCHIO
     Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
Widow
     She shall not.
PETRUCHIO
     I say she shall: and first begin with her.
KATHARINA
     Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
     And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
     To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
     It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
     Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
     And in no sense is meet or amiable.
     A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
     Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
     And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
     Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
     Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
     Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
     And for thy maintenance commits his body
     To painful labour both by sea and land,
     To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
     Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
     And craves no other tribute at thy hands
     But love, fair looks and true obedience;
     Too little payment for so great a debt.
     Such duty as the subject owes the prince
     Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
     And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
     And not obedient to his honest will,
     What is she but a foul contending rebel
     And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
     I am ashamed that women are so simple
     To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
     Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
     When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
     Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
     Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
     But that our soft conditions and our hearts
     Should well agree with our external parts?
     Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
     My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
     My heart as great, my reason haply more,
     To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
     But now I see our lances are but straws,
     Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
     That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
     Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
     And place your hands below your husband's foot:
     In token of which duty, if he please,
     My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
PETRUCHIO
     Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
LUCENTIO
     Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
VINCENTIO
     'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
LUCENTIO
     But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
PETRUCHIO
     Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
     We three are married, but you two are sped.
     To LUCENTIO
     'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
     And, being a winner, God give you good night!
     Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
HORTENSIO
     Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
LUCENTIO
     'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
     Exeunt
Measure for Measure
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace. ****
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Escalus.
ESCALUS
     My lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Of government the properties to unfold,
     Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
     Since I am put to know that your own science
     Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
     My strength can give you: then no more remains,
     But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
     And let them work. The nature of our people,
     Our city's institutions, and the terms
     For common justice, you're as pregnant in
     As art and practise hath enriched any
     That we remember. There is our commission,
     From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
     I say, bid come before us Angelo.
     Exit an Attendant
     What figure of us think you he will bear?
     For you must know, we have with special soul
     Elected him our absence to supply,
     Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
     And given his deputation all the organs
     Of our own power: what think you of it?
ESCALUS
     If any in Vienna be of worth
     To undergo such ample grace and honour,
     It is Lord Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Look where he comes.
     Enter ANGELO
ANGELO
     Always obedient to your grace's will,
     I come to know your pleasure.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Angelo,
     There is a kind of character in thy life,
     That to the observer doth thy history
     Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
     Are not thine own so proper as to waste
     Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
     Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
     Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
     Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
     As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
     But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
     The smallest scruple of her excellence
     But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
     Herself the glory of a creditor,
     Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
     To one that can my part in him advertise;
     Hold therefore, Angelo:--
     In our remove be thou at full ourself;
     Mortality and mercy in Vienna
     Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
     Though first in question, is thy secondary.
     Take thy commission.
ANGELO
     Now, good my lord,
     Let there be some more test made of my metal,
     Before so noble and so great a figure
     Be stamp'd upon it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     No more evasion:
     We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
     Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
     Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
     That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
     Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
     As time and our concernings shall importune,
     How it goes with us, and do look to know
     What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
     To the hopeful execution do I leave you
     Of your commissions.
ANGELO
     Yet give leave, my lord,
     That we may bring you something on the way.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     My haste may not admit it;
     Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
     With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
     So to enforce or qualify the laws
     As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
     I'll privily away. I love the people,
     But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
     Through it do well, I do not relish well
     Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
     Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
     That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
ANGELO
     The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ESCALUS
     Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
DUKE
     I thank you. Fare you well.
     Exit
ESCALUS
     I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
     To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
     To look into the bottom of my place:
     A power I have, but of what strength and nature
     I am not yet instructed.
ANGELO
     'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
     And we may soon our satisfaction have
     Touching that point.
ESCALUS
     I'll wait upon your honour.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A Street. ****
     Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
LUCIO
     If the duke with the other dukes come not to
     composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
     the dukes fall upon the king.
First Gentleman
     Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
     Hungary's!
Second Gentleman
     Amen.
LUCIO
     Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
     went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
     one out of the table.
Second Gentleman
     'Thou shalt not steal'?
LUCIO
     Ay, that he razed.
First Gentleman
     Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
     all the rest from their functions: they put forth
     to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
     the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
     well that prays for peace.
Second Gentleman
     I never heard any soldier dislike it.
LUCIO
     I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
     grace was said.
Second Gentleman
     No? a dozen times at least.
First Gentleman
     What, in metre?
LUCIO
     In any proportion or in any language.
First Gentleman
     I think, or in any religion.
LUCIO
     Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
     controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
     wicked villain, despite of all grace.
First Gentleman
     Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
LUCIO
     I grant; as there may between the lists and the
     velvet. Thou art the list.
First Gentleman
     And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
     a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
     be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
     art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
     feelingly now?
LUCIO
     I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
     feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
     confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
     live, forget to drink after thee.
First Gentleman
     I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
Second Gentleman
     Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
LUCIO
     Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
     have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
Second Gentleman
     To what, I pray?
LUCIO
     Judge.
Second Gentleman
     To three thousand dolours a year.
First Gentleman
     Ay, and more.
LUCIO
     A French crown more.
First Gentleman
     Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
     art full of error; I am sound.
LUCIO
     Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
     things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
     impiety has made a feast of thee.
     Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE
First Gentleman
     How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
     to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
Second Gentleman
     Who's that, I pray thee?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
First Gentleman
     Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
     him carried away; and, which is more, within these
     three days his head to be chopped off.
LUCIO
     But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
     Art thou sure of this?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
     Julietta with child.
LUCIO
     Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
     hours since, and he was ever precise in
     promise-keeping.
Second Gentleman
     Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
     speech we had to such a purpose.
First Gentleman
     But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
LUCIO
     Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
     Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
     with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
     custom-shrunk.
     Enter POMPEY
     How now! what's the news with you?
POMPEY
     Yonder man is carried to prison.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Well; what has he done?
POMPEY
     A woman.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     But what's his offence?
POMPEY
     Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     What, is there a maid with child by him?
POMPEY
     No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
     not heard of the proclamation, have you?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     What proclamation, man?
POMPEY
     All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     And what shall become of those in the city?
POMPEY
     They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
     but that a wise burgher put in for them.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
     pulled down?
POMPEY
     To the ground, mistress.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
     What shall become of me?
POMPEY
     Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
     clients: though you change your place, you need not
     change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
     Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
     have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
     will be considered.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
POMPEY
     Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
     prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
     Exeunt
     Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers
CLAUDIO
     Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
     Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
Provost
     I do it not in evil disposition,
     But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
CLAUDIO
     Thus can the demigod Authority
     Make us pay down for our offence by weight
     The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
     On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
     Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
LUCIO
     Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
CLAUDIO
     From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
     As surfeit is the father of much fast,
     So every scope by the immoderate use
     Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
     Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
     A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
LUCIO
     If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
     send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
     the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
     as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
     offence, Claudio?
CLAUDIO
     What but to speak of would offend again.
LUCIO
     What, is't murder?
CLAUDIO
     No.
LUCIO
     Lechery?
CLAUDIO
     Call it so.
Provost
     Away, sir! you must go.
CLAUDIO
     One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
LUCIO
     A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
     Is lechery so look'd after?
CLAUDIO
     Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
     I got possession of Julietta's bed:
     You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
     Save that we do the denunciation lack
     Of outward order: this we came not to,
     Only for propagation of a dower
     Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
     From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
     Till time had made them for us. But it chances
     The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
     With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
LUCIO
     With child, perhaps?
CLAUDIO
     Unhappily, even so.
     And the new deputy now for the duke--
     Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
     Or whether that the body public be
     A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
     Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
     He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
     Whether the tyranny be in his place,
     Or in his emmence that fills it up,
     I stagger in:--but this new governor
     Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
     Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
     So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
     And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
     Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
     Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
LUCIO
     I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
     thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
     may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
     him.
CLAUDIO
     I have done so, but he's not to be found.
     I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
     This day my sister should the cloister enter
     And there receive her approbation:
     Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
     Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
     To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
     I have great hope in that; for in her youth
     There is a prone and speechless dialect,
     Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
     When she will play with reason and discourse,
     And well she can persuade.
LUCIO
     I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
     like, which else would stand under grievous
     imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
     would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
     game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
CLAUDIO
     I thank you, good friend Lucio.
LUCIO
     Within two hours.
CLAUDIO
     Come, officer, away!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. A monastery. ****
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS
DUKE VINCENTIO
     No, holy father; throw away that thought;
     Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
     Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
     To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
     More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
     Of burning youth.
FRIAR THOMAS
     May your grace speak of it?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     My holy sir, none better knows than you
     How I have ever loved the life removed
     And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
     Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
     I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
     A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
     My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
     And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
     For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
     And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
     You will demand of me why I do this?
FRIAR THOMAS
     Gladly, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
     The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
     Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
     Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
     That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
     Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
     Only to stick it in their children's sight
     For terror, not to use, in time the rod
     Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
     Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
     And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
     The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
     Goes all decorum.
FRIAR THOMAS
     It rested in your grace
     To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
     And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
     Than in Lord Angelo.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I do fear, too dreadful:
     Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
     'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
     For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
     When evil deeds have their permissive pass
     And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
     I have on Angelo imposed the office;
     Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
     And yet my nature never in the fight
     To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
     I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
     Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
     Supply me with the habit and instruct me
     How I may formally in person bear me
     Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
     At our more leisure shall I render you;
     Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
     Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
     That his blood flows, or that his appetite
     Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
     If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A nunnery. ****
     Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA
ISABELLA
     And have you nuns no farther privileges?
FRANCISCA
     Are not these large enough?
ISABELLA
     Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
     But rather wishing a more strict restraint
     Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
LUCIO
     [Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!
ISABELLA
     Who's that which calls?
FRANCISCA
     It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
     Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
     You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
     When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
     But in the presence of the prioress:
     Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
     Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
     He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
     Exit
ISABELLA
     Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
     Enter LUCIO
LUCIO
     Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
     Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
     As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
     A novice of this place and the fair sister
     To her unhappy brother Claudio?
ISABELLA
     Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
     The rather for I now must make you know
     I am that Isabella and his sister.
LUCIO
     Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
     Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
ISABELLA
     Woe me! for what?
LUCIO
     For that which, if myself might be his judge,
     He should receive his punishment in thanks:
     He hath got his friend with child.
ISABELLA
     Sir, make me not your story.
LUCIO
     It is true.
     I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
     With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
     Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
     I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
     By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
     And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
     As with a saint.
ISABELLA
     You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
LUCIO
     Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
     Your brother and his lover have embraced:
     As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
     That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
     To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
     Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
ISABELLA
     Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
LUCIO
     Is she your cousin?
ISABELLA
     Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
     By vain though apt affection.
LUCIO
     She it is.
ISABELLA
     O, let him marry her.
LUCIO
     This is the point.
     The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
     Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
     In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
     By those that know the very nerves of state,
     His givings-out were of an infinite distance
     From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
     And with full line of his authority,
     Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
     Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
     The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
     But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
     With profits of the mind, study and fast.
     He--to give fear to use and liberty,
     Which have for long run by the hideous law,
     As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
     Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
     Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
     And follows close the rigour of the statute,
     To make him an example. All hope is gone,
     Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
     To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
     'Twixt you and your poor brother.
ISABELLA
     Doth he so seek his life?
LUCIO
     Has censured him
     Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
     A warrant for his execution.
ISABELLA
     Alas! what poor ability's in me
     To do him good?
LUCIO
     Assay the power you have.
ISABELLA
     My power? Alas, I doubt--
LUCIO
     Our doubts are traitors
     And make us lose the good we oft might win
     By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
     And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
     Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
     All their petitions are as freely theirs
     As they themselves would owe them.
ISABELLA
     I'll see what I can do.
LUCIO
     But speedily.
ISABELLA
     I will about it straight;
     No longer staying but to give the mother
     Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
     Commend me to my brother: soon at night
     I'll send him certain word of my success.
LUCIO
     I take my leave of you.
ISABELLA
     Good sir, adieu.
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house. ****
     Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other
     Attendants, behind
ANGELO
     We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
     Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
     And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
     Their perch and not their terror.
ESCALUS
     Ay, but yet
     Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
     Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
     Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
     Let but your honour know,
     Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
     That, in the working of your own affections,
     Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
     Or that the resolute acting of your blood
     Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
     Whether you had not sometime in your life
     Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
     And pull'd the law upon you.
ANGELO
     'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
     Another thing to fall. I not deny,
     The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
     May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
     Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
     That justice seizes: what know the laws
     That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
     The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
     Because we see it; but what we do not see
     We tread upon, and never think of it.
     You may not so extenuate his offence
     For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
     When I, that censure him, do so offend,
     Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
     And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
ESCALUS
     Be it as your wisdom will.
ANGELO
     Where is the provost?
Provost
     Here, if it like your honour.
ANGELO
     See that Claudio
     Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
     Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
     For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
     Exit Provost
ESCALUS
     [Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
     Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
     Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
     And some condemned for a fault alone.
     Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY
ELBOW
     Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
     a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
     common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
ANGELO
     How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
ELBOW
     If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
     constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
     justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
     honour two notorious benefactors.
ANGELO
     Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
     they not malefactors?
ELBOW
     If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
     are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
     of; and void of all profanation in the world that
     good Christians ought to have.
ESCALUS
     This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
ANGELO
     Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
     name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
POMPEY
     He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
ANGELO
     What are you, sir?
ELBOW
     He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
     serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
     say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
     professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
ESCALUS
     How know you that?
ELBOW
     My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
ESCALUS
     How? thy wife?
ELBOW
     Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
ESCALUS
     Dost thou detest her therefore?
ELBOW
     I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
     she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
     it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
ESCALUS
     How dost thou know that, constable?
ELBOW
     Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
     cardinally given, might have been accused in
     fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
ESCALUS
     By the woman's means?
ELBOW
     Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
     spit in his face, so she defied him.
POMPEY
     Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
ELBOW
     Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
     man; prove it.
ESCALUS
     Do you hear how he misplaces?
POMPEY
     Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
     saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
     sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
     distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
     dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
     such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
     good dishes,--
ESCALUS
     Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
POMPEY
     No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
     the right: but to the point. As I say, this
     Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
     being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
     prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
     Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
     rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
     honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
     not give you three-pence again.
FROTH
     No, indeed.
POMPEY
     Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
     cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
FROTH
     Ay, so I did indeed.
POMPEY
     Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
     remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
     cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
     good diet, as I told you,--
FROTH
     All this is true.
POMPEY
     Why, very well, then,--
ESCALUS
     Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
     was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
     complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
POMPEY
     Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
ESCALUS
     No, sir, nor I mean it not.
POMPEY
     Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
     leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
     here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
     father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
     Master Froth?
FROTH
     All-hallond eve.
POMPEY
     Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
     sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
     the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
     to sit, have you not?
FROTH
     I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
POMPEY
     Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
ANGELO
     This will last out a night in Russia,
     When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
     And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
     Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
ESCALUS
     I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
     Exit ANGELO
     Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
POMPEY
     Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
ELBOW
     I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
POMPEY
     I beseech your honour, ask me.
ESCALUS
     Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
POMPEY
     I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
     Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
     good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
ESCALUS
     Ay, sir, very well.
POMPEY
     Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
ESCALUS
     Well, I do so.
POMPEY
     Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
ESCALUS
     Why, no.
POMPEY
     I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
     thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
     worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
     constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
     your honour.
ESCALUS
     He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
ELBOW
     First, an it like you, the house is a respected
     house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
     mistress is a respected woman.
POMPEY
     By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
     person than any of us all.
ELBOW
     Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
     time has yet to come that she was ever respected
     with man, woman, or child.
POMPEY
     Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
ESCALUS
     Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
     this true?
ELBOW
     O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
     Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
     to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
     with me, let not your worship think me the poor
     duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
     I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
ESCALUS
     If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
     action of slander too.
ELBOW
     Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
     your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
ESCALUS
     Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
     that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
     continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
     are.
ELBOW
     Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
     wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
     to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
ESCALUS
     Where were you born, friend?
FROTH
     Here in Vienna, sir.
ESCALUS
     Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
FROTH
     Yes, an't please you, sir.
ESCALUS
     So. What trade are you of, sir?
POMPHEY
     Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
ESCALUS
     Your mistress' name?
POMPHEY
     Mistress Overdone.
ESCALUS
     Hath she had any more than one husband?
POMPEY
     Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
ESCALUS
     Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
     Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
     tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
     will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
     more of you.
FROTH
     I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
     come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
     in.
ESCALUS
     Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
     Exit FROTH
     Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
     name, Master tapster?
POMPEY
     Pompey.
ESCALUS
     What else?
POMPEY
     Bum, sir.
ESCALUS
     Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
     so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
     Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
     howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
     not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
POMPEY
     Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
ESCALUS
     How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
     do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
POMPEY
     If the law would allow it, sir.
ESCALUS
     But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
     not be allowed in Vienna.
POMPEY
     Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
     youth of the city?
ESCALUS
     No, Pompey.
POMPEY
     Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
     If your worship will take order for the drabs and
     the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
ESCALUS
     There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
     it is but heading and hanging.
POMPEY
     If you head and hang all that offend that way but
     for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
     commission for more heads: if this law hold in
     Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
     after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
     come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
ESCALUS
     Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
     prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
     you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
     no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
     I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
     Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
     have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
POMPEY
     I thank your worship for your good counsel:
     Aside
     but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
     better determine.
     Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
     The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
     Exit
ESCALUS
     Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
     constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
ELBOW
     Seven year and a half, sir.
ESCALUS
     I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
     continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
ELBOW
     And a half, sir.
ESCALUS
     Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
     wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
     in your ward sufficient to serve it?
ELBOW
     Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
     are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
     do it for some piece of money, and go through with
     all.
ESCALUS
     Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
     the most sufficient of your parish.
ELBOW
     To your worship's house, sir?
ESCALUS
     To my house. Fare you well.
     Exit ELBOW
     What's o'clock, think you?
Justice
     Eleven, sir.
ESCALUS
     I pray you home to dinner with me.
Justice
     I humbly thank you.
ESCALUS
     It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
     But there's no remedy.
Justice
     Lord Angelo is severe.
ESCALUS
     It is but needful:
     Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
     Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
     But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
     Come, sir.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Another room in the same. ****
     Enter Provost and a Servant
Servant
     He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
     I'll tell him of you.
Provost
     Pray you, do.
     Exit Servant
     I'll know
     His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
     He hath but as offended in a dream!
     All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
     To die for't!
     Enter ANGELO
ANGELO
     Now, what's the matter. Provost?
Provost
     Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
ANGELO
     Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
     Why dost thou ask again?
Provost
     Lest I might be too rash:
     Under your good correction, I have seen,
     When, after execution, judgment hath
     Repented o'er his doom.
ANGELO
     Go to; let that be mine:
     Do you your office, or give up your place,
     And you shall well be spared.
Provost
     I crave your honour's pardon.
     What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
     She's very near her hour.
ANGELO
     Dispose of her
     To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
     Re-enter Servant
Servant
     Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
     Desires access to you.
ANGELO
     Hath he a sister?
Provost
     Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
     And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
     If not already.
ANGELO
     Well, let her be admitted.
     Exit Servant
     See you the fornicatress be removed:
     Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
     There shall be order for't.
     Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO
Provost
     God save your honour!
ANGELO
     Stay a little while.
     To ISABELLA
     You're welcome: what's your will?
ISABELLA
     I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
     Please but your honour hear me.
ANGELO
     Well; what's your suit?
ISABELLA
     There is a vice that most I do abhor,
     And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
     For which I would not plead, but that I must;
     For which I must not plead, but that I am
     At war 'twixt will and will not.
ANGELO
     Well; the matter?
ISABELLA
     I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
     I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
     And not my brother.
Provost
     [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!
ANGELO
     Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
     Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
     Mine were the very cipher of a function,
     To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
     And let go by the actor.
ISABELLA
     O just but severe law!
     I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to him
     again, entreat him;
     Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
     You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
     You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
     To him, I say!
ISABELLA
     Must he needs die?
ANGELO
     Maiden, no remedy.
ISABELLA
     Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
     And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
ANGELO
     I will not do't.
ISABELLA
     But can you, if you would?
ANGELO
     Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
ISABELLA
     But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
     If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
     A s mine is to him?
ANGELO
     He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.
ISABELLA
     Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
     May call it back again. Well, believe this,
     No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
     Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
     The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
     Become them with one half so good a grace
     As mercy does.
     If he had been as you and you as he,
     You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
     Would not have been so stern.
ANGELO
     Pray you, be gone.
ISABELLA
     I would to heaven I had your potency,
     And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
     No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
     And what a prisoner.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA]
     Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
ANGELO
     Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
     And you but waste your words.
ISABELLA
     Alas, alas!
     Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
     And He that might the vantage best have took
     Found out the remedy. How would you be,
     If He, which is the top of judgment, should
     But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
     And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
     Like man new made.
ANGELO
     Be you content, fair maid;
     It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
     Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
     It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
ISABELLA
     To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
     He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
     We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
     With less respect than we do minister
     To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
     Who is it that hath died for this offence?
     There's many have committed it.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.
ANGELO
     The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
     Those many had not dared to do that evil,
     If the first that did the edict infringe
     Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
     Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
     Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
     Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
     And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
     Are now to have no successive degrees,
     But, ere they live, to end.
ISABELLA
     Yet show some pity.
ANGELO
     I show it most of all when I show justice;
     For then I pity those I do not know,
     Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
     And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
     Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
     Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
ISABELLA
     So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
     And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
     To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
     To use it like a giant.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.
ISABELLA
     Could great men thunder
     As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
     For every pelting, petty officer
     Would use his heaven for thunder;
     Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
     Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
     Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
     Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
     Drest in a little brief authority,
     Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
     His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
     Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
     As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
     Would all themselves laugh mortal.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! he
     will relent;
     He's coming; I perceive 't.
Provost
     [Aside] Pray heaven she win him!
ISABELLA
     We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
     Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
     But in the less foul profanation.
LUCIO
     Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
ISABELLA
     That in the captain's but a choleric word,
     Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.
ANGELO
     Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ISABELLA
     Because authority, though it err like others,
     Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
     That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
     Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
     That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
     A natural guiltiness such as is his,
     Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
     Against my brother's life.
ANGELO
     [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
     Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
ISABELLA
     Gentle my lord, turn back.
ANGELO
     I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
ISABELLA
     Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
ANGELO
     How! bribe me?
ISABELLA
     Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.
ISABELLA
     Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
     Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
     As fancy values them; but with true prayers
     That shall be up at heaven and enter there
     Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
     From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
     To nothing temporal.
ANGELO
     Well; come to me to-morrow.
LUCIO
     [Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away!
ISABELLA
     Heaven keep your honour safe!
ANGELO
     [Aside] Amen:
     For I am that way going to temptation,
     Where prayers cross.
ISABELLA
     At what hour to-morrow
     Shall I attend your lordship?
ANGELO
     At any time 'fore noon.
ISABELLA
     'Save your honour!
     Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost
ANGELO
     From thee, even from thy virtue!
     What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
     The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
     Ha!
     Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
     That, lying by the violet in the sun,
     Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
     Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
     That modesty may more betray our sense
     Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
     Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
     And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
     What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
     Dost thou desire her foully for those things
     That make her good? O, let her brother live!
     Thieves for their robbery have authority
     When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
     That I desire to hear her speak again,
     And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
     O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
     With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
     Is that temptation that doth goad us on
     To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
     With all her double vigour, art and nature,
     Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
     Subdues me quite. Even till now,
     When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. A room in a prison. ****
     Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
Provost
     I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Bound by my charity and my blest order,
     I come to visit the afflicted spirits
     Here in the prison. Do me the common right
     To let me see them and to make me know
     The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
     To them accordingly.
Provost
     I would do more than that, if more were needful.
     Enter JULIET
     Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
     Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
     Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
     And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
     More fit to do another such offence
     Than die for this.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     When must he die?
Provost
     As I do think, to-morrow.
     I have provided for you: stay awhile,
     To JULIET
     And you shall be conducted.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
JULIET
     I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
     And try your penitence, if it be sound,
     Or hollowly put on.
JULIET
     I'll gladly learn.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Love you the man that wrong'd you?
JULIET
     Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     So then it seems your most offenceful act
     Was mutually committed?
JULIET
     Mutually.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
JULIET
     I do confess it, and repent it, father.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
     As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
     Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
     Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
     But as we stand in fear,--
JULIET
     I do repent me, as it is an evil,
     And take the shame with joy.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     There rest.
     Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
     And I am going with instruction to him.
     Grace go with you, Benedicite!
     Exit
JULIET
     Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
     That respites me a life, whose very comfort
     Is still a dying horror!
Provost
     'Tis pity of him.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house. ****
     Enter ANGELO
ANGELO
     When I would pray and think, I think and pray
     To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
     Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
     Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
     As if I did but only chew his name;
     And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
     Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
     Is like a good thing, being often read,
     Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
     Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
     Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
     Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
     How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
     Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
     To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
     Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
     'Tis not the devil's crest.
     Enter a Servant
     How now! who's there?
Servant
     One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
ANGELO
     Teach her the way.
     Exit Servant
     O heavens!
     Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
     Making both it unable for itself,
     And dispossessing all my other parts
     Of necessary fitness?
     So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
     Come all to help him, and so stop the air
     By which he should revive: and even so
     The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
     Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
     Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
     Must needs appear offence.
     Enter ISABELLA
     How now, fair maid?
ISABELLA
     I am come to know your pleasure.
ANGELO
     That you might know it, would much better please me
     Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
ISABELLA
     Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
ANGELO
     Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I
     yet he must die.
ISABELLA
     Under your sentence?
ANGELO
     Yea.
ISABELLA
     When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
     Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
     That his soul sicken not.
ANGELO
     Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
     To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
     A man already made, as to remit
     Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
     In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
     Falsely to take away a life true made
     As to put metal in restrained means
     To make a false one.
ISABELLA
     'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
ANGELO
     Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
     Which had you rather, that the most just law
     Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
     Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
     As she that he hath stain'd?
ISABELLA
     Sir, believe this,
     I had rather give my body than my soul.
ANGELO
     I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
     Stand more for number than for accompt.
ISABELLA
     How say you?
ANGELO
     Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
     Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
     I, now the voice of the recorded law,
     Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
     Might there not be a charity in sin
     To save this brother's life?
ISABELLA
     Please you to do't,
     I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
     It is no sin at all, but charity.
ANGELO
     Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
     Were equal poise of sin and charity.
ISABELLA
     That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
     Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
     If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
     To have it added to the faults of mine,
     And nothing of your answer.
ANGELO
     Nay, but hear me.
     Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
     Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.
ISABELLA
     Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
     But graciously to know I am no better.
ANGELO
     Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
     When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
     Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
     Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
     To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
     Your brother is to die.
ISABELLA
     So.
ANGELO
     And his offence is so, as it appears,
     Accountant to the law upon that pain.
ISABELLA
     True.
ANGELO
     Admit no other way to save his life,--
     As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
     But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
     Finding yourself desired of such a person,
     Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
     Could fetch your brother from the manacles
     Of the all-building law; and that there were
     No earthly mean to save him, but that either
     You must lay down the treasures of your body
     To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
     What would you do?
ISABELLA
     As much for my poor brother as myself:
     That is, were I under the terms of death,
     The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
     And strip myself to death, as to a bed
     That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
     My body up to shame.
ANGELO
     Then must your brother die.
ISABELLA
     And 'twere the cheaper way:
     Better it were a brother died at once,
     Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
     Should die for ever.
ANGELO
     Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
     That you have slander'd so?
ISABELLA
     Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
     Are of two houses: lawful mercy
     Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
ANGELO
     You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
     And rather proved the sliding of your brother
     A merriment than a vice.
ISABELLA
     O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
     To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
     I something do excuse the thing I hate,
     For his advantage that I dearly love.
ANGELO
     We are all frail.
ISABELLA
     Else let my brother die,
     If not a feodary, but only he
     Owe and succeed thy weakness.
ANGELO
     Nay, women are frail too.
ISABELLA
     Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
     Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
     Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
     In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
     For we are soft as our complexions are,
     And credulous to false prints.
ANGELO
     I think it well:
     And from this testimony of your own sex,--
     Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
     Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
     I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
     That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
     If you be one, as you are well express'd
     By all external warrants, show it now,
     By putting on the destined livery.
ISABELLA
     I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
     Let me entreat you speak the former language.
ANGELO
     Plainly conceive, I love you.
ISABELLA
     My brother did love Juliet,
     And you tell me that he shall die for it.
ANGELO
     He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
ISABELLA
     I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
     Which seems a little fouler than it is,
     To pluck on others.
ANGELO
     Believe me, on mine honour,
     My words express my purpose.
ISABELLA
     Ha! little honour to be much believed,
     And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
     I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
     Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
     Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
     What man thou art.
ANGELO
     Who will believe thee, Isabel?
     My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
     My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
     Will so your accusation overweigh,
     That you shall stifle in your own report
     And smell of calumny. I have begun,
     And now I give my sensual race the rein:
     Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
     Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
     That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
     By yielding up thy body to my will;
     Or else he must not only die the death,
     But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
     To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
     Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
     I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
     Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
     Exit
ISABELLA
     To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
     Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
     That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
     Either of condemnation or approof;
     Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
     Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
     To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
     Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
     Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
     That, had he twenty heads to tender down
     On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
     Before his sister should her body stoop
     To such abhorr'd pollution.
     Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
     More than our brother is our chastity.
     I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
     And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
     Exit
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. A room in the prison. ****
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO
     So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
CLAUDIO
     The miserable have no other medicine
     But only hope:
     I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Be absolute for death; either death or life
     Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
     If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
     That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
     Servile to all the skyey influences,
     That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
     Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
     For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
     And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
     For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
     Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
     For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
     Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
     And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
     Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
     For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
     That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
     For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
     And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
     For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
     After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
     For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
     Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
     And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
     For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
     The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
     Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
     For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
     But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
     Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
     Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
     Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
     Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
     To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
     That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
     Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
     That makes these odds all even.
CLAUDIO
     I humbly thank you.
     To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
     And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
ISABELLA
     [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
Provost
     Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
CLAUDIO
     Most holy sir, I thank you.
     Enter ISABELLA
ISABELLA
     My business is a word or two with Claudio.
Provost
     And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Provost, a word with you.
Provost
     As many as you please.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
     Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost
CLAUDIO
     Now, sister, what's the comfort?
ISABELLA
     Why,
     As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
     Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
     Intends you for his swift ambassador,
     Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
     Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
     To-morrow you set on.
CLAUDIO
     Is there no remedy?
ISABELLA
     None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
     To cleave a heart in twain.
CLAUDIO
     But is there any?
ISABELLA
     Yes, brother, you may live:
     There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
     If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
     But fetter you till death.
CLAUDIO
     Perpetual durance?
ISABELLA
     Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
     Though all the world's vastidity you had,
     To a determined scope.
CLAUDIO
     But in what nature?
ISABELLA
     In such a one as, you consenting to't,
     Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
     And leave you naked.
CLAUDIO
     Let me know the point.
ISABELLA
     O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
     Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
     And six or seven winters more respect
     Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
     The sense of death is most in apprehension;
     And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
     In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
     As when a giant dies.
CLAUDIO
     Why give you me this shame?
     Think you I can a resolution fetch
     From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
     I will encounter darkness as a bride,
     And hug it in mine arms.
ISABELLA
     There spake my brother; there my father's grave
     Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
     Thou art too noble to conserve a life
     In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
     Whose settled visage and deliberate word
     Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
     As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
     His filth within being cast, he would appear
     A pond as deep as hell.
CLAUDIO
     The prenzie Angelo!
ISABELLA
     O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
     The damned'st body to invest and cover
     In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
     If I would yield him my virginity,
     Thou mightst be freed.
CLAUDIO
     O heavens! it cannot be.
ISABELLA
     Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
     So to offend him still. This night's the time
     That I should do what I abhor to name,
     Or else thou diest to-morrow.
CLAUDIO
     Thou shalt not do't.
ISABELLA
     O, were it but my life,
     I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
     As frankly as a pin.
CLAUDIO
     Thanks, dear Isabel.
ISABELLA
     Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
CLAUDIO
     Yes. Has he affections in him,
     That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
     When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
     Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
ISABELLA
     Which is the least?
CLAUDIO
     If it were damnable, he being so wise,
     Why would he for the momentary trick
     Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
ISABELLA
     What says my brother?
CLAUDIO
     Death is a fearful thing.
ISABELLA
     And shamed life a hateful.
CLAUDIO
     Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
     To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
     This sensible warm motion to become
     A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
     To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
     In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
     To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
     And blown with restless violence round about
     The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
     Of those that lawless and incertain thought
     Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
     The weariest and most loathed worldly life
     That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
     Can lay on nature is a paradise
     To what we fear of death.
ISABELLA
     Alas, alas!
CLAUDIO
     Sweet sister, let me live:
     What sin you do to save a brother's life,
     Nature dispenses with the deed so far
     That it becomes a virtue.
ISABELLA
     O you beast!
     O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
     Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
     Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
     From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
     Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
     For such a warped slip of wilderness
     Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
     Die, perish! Might but my bending down
     Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
     I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
     No word to save thee.
CLAUDIO
     Nay, hear me, Isabel.
ISABELLA
     O, fie, fie, fie!
     Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
     Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
     'Tis best thou diest quickly.
CLAUDIO
     O hear me, Isabella!
     Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
ISABELLA
     What is your will?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
     by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
     would require is likewise your own benefit.
ISABELLA
     I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
     stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
     Walks apart
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
     and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
     corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
     virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
     of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
     hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
     glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
     know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
     death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
     that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
     your knees and make ready.
CLAUDIO
     Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
     with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Hold you there: farewell.
     Exit CLAUDIO
     Provost, a word with you!
     Re-enter Provost
Provost
     What's your will, father
DUKE VINCENTIO
     That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
     awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
     habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
Provost
     In good time.
     Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward
DUKE VINCENTIO
     The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
     the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
     brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
     your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
     fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
     fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
     that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
     wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
     substitute, and to save your brother?
ISABELLA
     I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
     brother die by the law than my son should be
     unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
     deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
     speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
     discover his government.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
     now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
     trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
     advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
     remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
     that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
     lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
     the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
     person; and much please the absent duke, if
     peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
     this business.
ISABELLA
     Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
     anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
     you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
     Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
ISABELLA
     I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
     to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
     which time of the contract and limit of the
     solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
     having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
     sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
     poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
     renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
     kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
     her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
     combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
ISABELLA
     Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
     with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
     pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
     bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
     wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
     is washed with them, but relents not.
ISABELLA
     What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
     from the world! What corruption in this life, that
     it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
     cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
     you from dishonour in doing it.
ISABELLA
     Show me how, good father.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
     of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
     in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
     like an impediment in the current, made it more
     violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
     requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
     his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
     this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
     not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
     silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
     This being granted in course,--and now follows
     all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
     your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
     acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
     her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
     saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
     advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
     will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
     think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
     of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
     What think you of it?
ISABELLA
     The image of it gives me content already; and I
     trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
     to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
     bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
     presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
     grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
     place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
     it may be quickly.
ISABELLA
     I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
     Exeunt severally
**** SCENE II. The street before the prison. ****
     Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other,
     ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY
ELBOW
     Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
     needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
     shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O heavens! what stuff is here
POMPEY
     'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
     merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
     order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
     furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
     craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
ELBOW
     Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     And you, good brother father. What offence hath
     this man made you, sir?
ELBOW
     Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
     take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
     upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
     sent to the deputy.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
     The evil that thou causest to be done,
     That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
     What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
     From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
     From their abominable and beastly touches
     I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
     Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
     So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
POMPEY
     Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
     sir, I would prove--
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
     Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
     Correction and instruction must both work
     Ere this rude beast will profit.
ELBOW
     He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
     warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
     he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
     as good go a mile on his errand.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     That we were all, as some would seem to be,
     From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
ELBOW
     His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
POMPEY
     I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
     friend of mine.
     Enter LUCIO
LUCIO
     How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
     Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
     none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
     had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
     extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
     sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
     not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
     thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
     the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
     trick of it?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Still thus, and thus; still worse!
LUCIO
     How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
     still, ha?
POMPEY
     Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
     is herself in the tub.
LUCIO
     Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
     so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
     an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
     to prison, Pompey?
POMPEY
     Yes, faith, sir.
LUCIO
     Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
     sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?
ELBOW
     For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
LUCIO
     Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
     due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
     doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
     Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
     Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
     will keep the house.
POMPEY
     I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
LUCIO
     No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
     I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
     you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
     more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     And you.
LUCIO
     Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
ELBOW
     Come your ways, sir; come.
POMPEY
     You will not bail me, then, sir?
LUCIO
     Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
     what news?
ELBOW
     Come your ways, sir; come.
LUCIO
     Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
     Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers
     What news, friar, of the duke?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I know none. Can you tell me of any?
LUCIO
     Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
     some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
LUCIO
     It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
     the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
     to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
     puts transgression to 't.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     He does well in 't.
LUCIO
     A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
     him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
LUCIO
     Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
     it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
     it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
     down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
     woman after this downright way of creation: is it
     true, think you?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     How should he be made, then?
LUCIO
     Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
     was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
     certain that when he makes water his urine is
     congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
     motion generative; that's infallible.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
LUCIO
     Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
     rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
     man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
     Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
     hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
     a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
     knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I never heard the absent duke much detected for
     women; he was not inclined that way.
LUCIO
     O, sir, you are deceived.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     'Tis not possible.
LUCIO
     Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
     his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
     duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
     that let me inform you.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You do him wrong, surely.
LUCIO
     Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
     duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
     withdrawing.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     What, I prithee, might be the cause?
LUCIO
     No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
     teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
     understand, the greater file of the subject held the
     duke to be wise.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Wise! why, no question but he was.
LUCIO
     A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
     the very stream of his life and the business he hath
     helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
     proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
     bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
     envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
     Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
     knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
LUCIO
     Sir, I know him, and I love him.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
     dearer love.
LUCIO
     Come, sir, I know what I know.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
     you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
     prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
     answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
     you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
     upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
LUCIO
     Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
     report you.
LUCIO
     I fear you not.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
     imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
     can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
LUCIO
     I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
     friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
     Claudio die to-morrow or no?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Why should he die, sir?
LUCIO
     Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
     the duke we talk of were returned again: the
     ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
     continency; sparrows must not build in his
     house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
     yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
     never bring them to light: would he were returned!
     Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
     Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
     duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
     Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
     he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
     bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
     Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO
     No might nor greatness in mortality
     Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
     The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
     Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
     But who comes here?
     Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
ESCALUS
     Go; away with her to prison!
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
     a merciful man; good my lord.
ESCALUS
     Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
     the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
     the tyrant.
Provost
     A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
     your honour.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
     My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
     Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
     duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
     is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
     I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!
ESCALUS
     That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
     called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
     no more words.
     Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
     Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
     Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
     with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
     if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
     so with him.
Provost
     So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
     advised him for the entertainment of death.
ESCALUS
     Good even, good father.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Bliss and goodness on you!
ESCALUS
     Of whence are you?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Not of this country, though my chance is now
     To use it for my time: I am a brother
     Of gracious order, late come from the See
     In special business from his holiness.
ESCALUS
     What news abroad i' the world?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     None, but that there is so great a fever on
     goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
     novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
     to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
     to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
     truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
     security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
     upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
     news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
     pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
ESCALUS
     One that, above all other strifes, contended
     especially to know himself.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     What pleasure was he given to?
ESCALUS
     Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
     any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
     gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
     his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
     and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
     prepared. I am made to understand that you have
     lent him visitation.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     He professes to have received no sinister measure
     from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
     to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
     to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
     deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
     leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
     resolved to die.
ESCALUS
     You have paid the heavens your function, and the
     prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
     laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
     shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
     found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
     he is indeed Justice.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     If his own life answer the straitness of his
     proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
     chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
ESCALUS
     I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Peace be with you!
     Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost
     He who the sword of heaven will bear
     Should be as holy as severe;
     Pattern in himself to know,
     Grace to stand, and virtue go;
     More nor less to others paying
     Than by self-offences weighing.
     Shame to him whose cruel striking
     Kills for faults of his own liking!
     Twice treble shame on Angelo,
     To weed my vice and let his grow!
     O, what may man within him hide,
     Though angel on the outward side!
     How may likeness made in crimes,
     Making practise on the times,
     To draw with idle spiders' strings
     Most ponderous and substantial things!
     Craft against vice I must apply:
     With Angelo to-night shall lie
     His old betrothed but despised;
     So disguise shall, by the disguised,
     Pay with falsehood false exacting,
     And perform an old contracting.
     Exit
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. The moated grange at ST. LUKE's. ****
     Enter MARIANA and a Boy
     Boy sings
     Take, O, take those lips away,
     That so sweetly were forsworn;
     And those eyes, the break of day,
     Lights that do mislead the morn:
     But my kisses bring again, bring again;
     Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.
MARIANA
     Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
     Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
     Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
     Exit Boy
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
     I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
     You had not found me here so musical:
     Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
     My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
     To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
     I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
     for me here to-day? much upon this time have
     I promised here to meet.
MARIANA
     You have not been inquired after:
     I have sat here all day.
     Enter ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
     now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
     be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
MARIANA
     I am always bound to you.
     Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Very well met, and well come.
     What is the news from this good deputy?
ISABELLA
     He hath a garden circummured with brick,
     Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
     And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
     That makes his opening with this bigger key:
     This other doth command a little door
     Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
     There have I made my promise
     Upon the heavy middle of the night
     To call upon him.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
ISABELLA
     I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
     With whispering and most guilty diligence,
     In action all of precept, he did show me
     The way twice o'er.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Are there no other tokens
     Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
ISABELLA
     No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
     And that I have possess'd him my most stay
     Can be but brief; for I have made him know
     I have a servant comes with me along,
     That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
     I come about my brother.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     'Tis well borne up.
     I have not yet made known to Mariana
     A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
     Re-enter MARIANA
     I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
     She comes to do you good.
ISABELLA
     I do desire the like.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
MARIANA
     Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
     Who hath a story ready for your ear.
     I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
     The vaporous night approaches.
MARIANA
     Will't please you walk aside?
     Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
     Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
     Run with these false and most contrarious quests
     Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
     Make thee the father of their idle dreams
     And rack thee in their fancies.
     Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA
     Welcome, how agreed?
ISABELLA
     She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
     If you advise it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It is not my consent,
     But my entreaty too.
ISABELLA
     Little have you to say
     When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
     'Remember now my brother.'
MARIANA
     Fear me not.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
     He is your husband on a pre-contract:
     To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
     Sith that the justice of your title to him
     Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
     Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A room in the prison. ****
     Enter Provost and POMPEY
Provost
     Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
POMPEY
     If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
     married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
     cut off a woman's head.
Provost
     Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
     direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
     and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
     executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
     you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
     redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
     your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
     with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
     notorious bawd.
POMPEY
     Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
     but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
     would be glad to receive some instruction from my
     fellow partner.
Provost
     What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
     Enter ABHORSON
ABHORSON
     Do you call, sir?
Provost
     Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
     your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
     him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
     not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
     cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
ABHORSON
     A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
Provost
     Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
     the scale.
     Exit
POMPEY
     Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
     good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
     look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
ABHORSON
     Ay, sir; a mystery
POMPEY
     Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
     your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
     using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
     but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
     should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
ABHORSON
     Sir, it is a mystery.
POMPEY
     Proof?
ABHORSON
     Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
     too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
     big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
     thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
     apparel fits your thief.
     Re-enter Provost
Provost
     Are you agreed?
POMPEY
     Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
     a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
     oftener ask forgiveness.
Provost
     You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
     to-morrow four o'clock.
ABHORSON
     Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
POMPEY
     I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
     occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
     me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
     a good turn.
Provost
     Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
     Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
     The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
     Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
     Enter CLAUDIO
     Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
     'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
     Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
CLAUDIO
     As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
     When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
     He will not wake.
Provost
     Who can do good on him?
     Well, go, prepare yourself.
     Knocking within
     But, hark, what noise?
     Heaven give your spirits comfort!
     Exit CLAUDIO
     By and by.
     I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
     For the most gentle Claudio.
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
     Welcome father.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
     Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
Provost
     None, since the curfew rung.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Not Isabel?
Provost
     No.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     They will, then, ere't be long.
Provost
     What comfort is for Claudio?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     There's some in hope.
Provost
     It is a bitter deputy.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
     Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
     He doth with holy abstinence subdue
     That in himself which he spurs on his power
     To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
     Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
     But this being so, he's just.
     Knocking within
     Now are they come.
     Exit Provost
     This is a gentle provost: seldom when
     The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
     Knocking within
     How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
     That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
     Re-enter Provost
Provost
     There he must stay until the officer
     Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
     But he must die to-morrow?
Provost
     None, sir, none.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
     You shall hear more ere morning.
Provost
     Happily
     You something know; yet I believe there comes
     No countermand; no such example have we:
     Besides, upon the very siege of justice
     Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
     Profess'd the contrary.
     Enter a Messenger
     This is his lordship's man.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     And here comes Claudio's pardon.
Messenger
     [Giving a paper]
     My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
     further charge, that you swerve not from the
     smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
     other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
     it is almost day.
Provost
     I shall obey him.
     Exit Messenger
DUKE VINCENTIO
     [Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
     For which the pardoner himself is in.
     Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
     When it is born in high authority:
     When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
     That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
     Now, sir, what news?
Provost
     I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
     in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
     putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Pray you, let's hear.
Provost
     [Reads]
     'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
     Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
     afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
     let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
     this be duly performed; with a thought that more
     depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
     not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
     What say you to this, sir?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
     afternoon?
Provost
     A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
     that is a prisoner nine years old.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     How came it that the absent duke had not either
     delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
     have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
Provost
     His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
     indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
     Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It is now apparent?
Provost
     Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
     seems he to be touched?
Provost
     A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
     as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
     of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
     mortality, and desperately mortal.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     He wants advice.
Provost
     He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
     of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
     would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
     entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
     to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
     warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
     provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
     truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
     boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
     Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
     no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
     sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
     manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
     for the which you are to do me both a present and a
     dangerous courtesy.
Provost
     Pray, sir, in what?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     In the delaying death.
Provost
     A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
     and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
     his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
     as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
     instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
     be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
Provost
     Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
     Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
     the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
     death: you know the course is common. If any thing
     fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
     fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
     against it with my life.
Provost
     Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
Provost
     To him, and to his substitutes.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
     avouch the justice of your dealing?
Provost
     But what likelihood is in that?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
     you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
     persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
     further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
     Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
     duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
     signet is not strange to you.
Provost
     I know them both.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
     shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
     shall find, within these two days he will be here.
     This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
     very day receives letters of strange tenor;
     perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
     into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
     is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
     shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
     things should be: all difficulties are but easy
     when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
     with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
     shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
     are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
     Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Another room in the same. ****
     Enter POMPEY
POMPEY
     I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
     of profession: one would think it were Mistress
     Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
     customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
     for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
     ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
     five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
     much in request, for the old women were all dead.
     Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
     Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
     peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
     beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
     Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
     Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
     Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
     Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
     great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
     Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
     our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
     Enter ABHORSON
ABHORSON
     Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
POMPEY
     Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
     Master Barnardine!
ABHORSON
     What, ho, Barnardine!
BARNARDINE
     [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
     noise there? What are you?
POMPEY
     Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
     good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
BARNARDINE
     [Within] Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.
ABHORSON
     Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
POMPEY
     Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
     executed, and sleep afterwards.
ABHORSON
     Go in to him, and fetch him out.
POMPEY
     He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
ABHORSON
     Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
POMPEY
     Very ready, sir.
     Enter BARNARDINE
BARNARDINE
     How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
ABHORSON
     Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
     prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.
BARNARDINE
     You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
     fitted for 't.
POMPEY
     O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
     and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
     sounder all the next day.
ABHORSON
     Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
     we jest now, think you?
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
     you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
     you and pray with you.
BARNARDINE
     Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
     and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
     shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
     consent to die this day, that's certain.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
     Look forward on the journey you shall go.
BARNARDINE
     I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
     persuasion.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     But hear you.
BARNARDINE
     Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
     come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
     Exit
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
     After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
     Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
     Re-enter Provost
Provost
     Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
     And to transport him in the mind he is
     Were damnable.
Provost
     Here in the prison, father,
     There died this morning of a cruel fever
     One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
     A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
     Just of his colour. What if we do omit
     This reprobate till he were well inclined;
     And satisfy the deputy with the visage
     Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
     Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
     Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
     And sent according to command; whiles I
     Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
Provost
     This shall be done, good father, presently.
     But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
     And how shall we continue Claudio,
     To save me from the danger that might come
     If he were known alive?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Let this be done.
     Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
     Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
     To the under generation, you shall find
     Your safety manifested.
Provost
     I am your free dependant.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
     Exit Provost
     Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
     The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
     Shall witness to him I am near at home,
     And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
     To enter publicly: him I'll desire
     To meet me at the consecrated fount
     A league below the city; and from thence,
     By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
     We shall proceed with Angelo.
     Re-enter Provost
Provost
     Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
     For I would commune with you of such things
     That want no ear but yours.
Provost
     I'll make all speed.
     Exit
ISABELLA
     [Within] Peace, ho, be here!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
     If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
     But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
     To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
     When it is least expected.
     Enter ISABELLA
ISABELLA
     Ho, by your leave!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
ISABELLA
     The better, given me by so holy a man.
     Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
     His head is off and sent to Angelo.
ISABELLA
     Nay, but it is not so.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
     In your close patience.
ISABELLA
     O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You shall not be admitted to his sight.
ISABELLA
     Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
     Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
     Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
     Mark what I say, which you shall find
     By every syllable a faithful verity:
     The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
     One of our convent, and his confessor,
     Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
     Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
     Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
     There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
     In that good path that I would wish it go,
     And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
     Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
     And general honour.
ISABELLA
     I am directed by you.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
     'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
     Say, by this token, I desire his company
     At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
     I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
     Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
     Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
     I am combined by a sacred vow
     And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
     Command these fretting waters from your eyes
     With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
     If I pervert your course. Who's here?
     Enter LUCIO
LUCIO
     Good even. Friar, where's the provost?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Not within, sir.
LUCIO
     O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
     thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
     to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
     my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
     me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
     to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
     if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
     at home, he had lived.
     Exit ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
     reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
LUCIO
     Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
     he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
LUCIO
     Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
     I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
     they be true; if not true, none were enough.
LUCIO
     I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Did you such a thing?
LUCIO
     Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
     they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
LUCIO
     By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
     if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
     it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house. ****
     Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS
ESCALUS
     Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
ANGELO
     In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
     show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
     not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
     redeliver our authorities there
ESCALUS
     I guess not.
ANGELO
     And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
     entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
     they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
ESCALUS
     He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
     complaints, and to deliver us from devices
     hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
     against us.
ANGELO
     Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
     i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
     notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
     him.
ESCALUS
     I shall, sir. Fare you well.
ANGELO
     Good night.
     Exit ESCALUS
     This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
     And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
     And by an eminent body that enforced
     The law against it! But that her tender shame
     Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
     How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
     For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
     That no particular scandal once can touch
     But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
     Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
     Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
     By so receiving a dishonour'd life
     With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
     A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
     Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
     Exit
**** SCENE V. Fields without the town. ****
     Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER
DUKE VINCENTIO
     These letters at fit time deliver me
     Giving letters
     The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
     The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
     And hold you ever to our special drift;
     Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
     As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
     And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
     To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
     And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
     But send me Flavius first.
FRIAR PETER
     It shall be speeded well.
     Exit
     Enter VARRIUS
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
     Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
     Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. Street near the city gate. ****
     Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA
ISABELLA
     To speak so indirectly I am loath:
     I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
     That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
     He says, to veil full purpose.
MARIANA
     Be ruled by him.
ISABELLA
     Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
     He speak against me on the adverse side,
     I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
     That's bitter to sweet end.
MARIANA
     I would Friar Peter--
ISABELLA
     O, peace! the friar is come.
     Enter FRIAR PETER
FRIAR PETER
     Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
     Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
     He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
     The generous and gravest citizens
     Have hent the gates, and very near upon
     The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
     Exeunt
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. The city gate. ****
     MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their stand. Enter DUKE
     VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers,
     and Citizens, at several doors
DUKE VINCENTIO
     My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
     Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
ANGELO ESCALUS
     Happy return be to your royal grace!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Many and hearty thankings to you both.
     We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
     Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
     Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
     Forerunning more requital.
ANGELO
     You make my bonds still greater.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
     To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
     When it deserves, with characters of brass,
     A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
     And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
     And let the subject see, to make them know
     That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
     Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
     You must walk by us on our other hand;
     And good supporters are you.
     FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward
FRIAR PETER
     Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
ISABELLA
     Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
     Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
     O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
     By throwing it on any other object
     Till you have heard me in my true complaint
     And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
     Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
     Reveal yourself to him.
ISABELLA
     O worthy duke,
     You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
     Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
     Must either punish me, not being believed,
     Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
ANGELO
     My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
     She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
     Cut off by course of justice,--
ISABELLA
     By course of justice!
ANGELO
     And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
ISABELLA
     Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
     That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
     That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
     That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
     An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
     Is it not strange and strange?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Nay, it is ten times strange.
ISABELLA
     It is not truer he is Angelo
     Than this is all as true as it is strange:
     Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
     To the end of reckoning.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Away with her! Poor soul,
     She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
ISABELLA
     O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
     There is another comfort than this world,
     That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
     That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
     That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
     But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
     May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
     As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
     In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
     Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
     If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
     Had I more name for badness.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     By mine honesty,
     If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
     Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
     Such a dependency of thing on thing,
     As e'er I heard in madness.
ISABELLA
     O gracious duke,
     Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
     For inequality; but let your reason serve
     To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
     And hide the false seems true.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Many that are not mad
     Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
ISABELLA
     I am the sister of one Claudio,
     Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
     To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
     I, in probation of a sisterhood,
     Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
     As then the messenger,--
LUCIO
     That's I, an't like your grace:
     I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
     To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
     For her poor brother's pardon.
ISABELLA
     That's he indeed.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You were not bid to speak.
LUCIO
     No, my good lord;
     Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I wish you now, then;
     Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
     A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
     Be perfect.
LUCIO
     I warrant your honour.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
ISABELLA
     This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
LUCIO
     Right.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
     To speak before your time. Proceed.
ISABELLA
     I went
     To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
DUKE VINCENTIO
     That's somewhat madly spoken.
ISABELLA
     Pardon it;
     The phrase is to the matter.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Mended again. The matter; proceed.
ISABELLA
     In brief, to set the needless process by,
     How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
     How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
     For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
     I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
     He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
     To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
     Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
     My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
     And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
     His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
     For my poor brother's head.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     This is most likely!
ISABELLA
     O, that it were as like as it is true!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
     Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
     In hateful practise. First, his integrity
     Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
     That with such vehemency he should pursue
     Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
     He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
     And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
     Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
     Thou camest here to complain.
ISABELLA
     And is this all?
     Then, O you blessed ministers above,
     Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
     Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
     In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
     As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
     To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
     A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
     On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
     Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
ISABELLA
     One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
LUCIO
     My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
     I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
     For certain words he spake against your grace
     In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
     And to set on this wretched woman here
     Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
LUCIO
     But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
     I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
     A very scurvy fellow.
FRIAR PETER
     Blessed be your royal grace!
     I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
     Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
     Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
     Who is as free from touch or soil with her
     As she from one ungot.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     We did believe no less.
     Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
FRIAR PETER
     I know him for a man divine and holy;
     Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
     As he's reported by this gentleman;
     And, on my trust, a man that never yet
     Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
LUCIO
     My lord, most villanously; believe it.
FRIAR PETER
     Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
     But at this instant he is sick my lord,
     Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
     Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
     Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
     To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
     Is true and false; and what he with his oath
     And all probation will make up full clear,
     Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
     To justify this worthy nobleman,
     So vulgarly and personally accused,
     Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
     Till she herself confess it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Good friar, let's hear it.
     ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward
     Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
     O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
     Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
     In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
     Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
     First, let her show her face, and after speak.
MARIANA
     Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
     Until my husband bid me.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     What, are you married?
MARIANA
     No, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Are you a maid?
MARIANA
     No, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     A widow, then?
MARIANA
     Neither, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
LUCIO
     My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
     neither maid, widow, nor wife.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
     To prattle for himself.
LUCIO
     Well, my lord.
MARIANA
     My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
     And I confess besides I am no maid:
     I have known my husband; yet my husband
     Knows not that ever he knew me.
LUCIO
     He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
LUCIO
     Well, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
MARIANA
     Now I come to't my lord
     She that accuses him of fornication,
     In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
     And charges him my lord, with such a time
     When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
     With all the effect of love.
ANGELO
     Charges she more than me?
MARIANA
     Not that I know.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     No? you say your husband.
MARIANA
     Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
     Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
     But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
ANGELO
     This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
MARIANA
     My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
     Unveiling
     This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
     Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
     This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
     Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
     That took away the match from Isabel,
     And did supply thee at thy garden-house
     In her imagined person.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Know you this woman?
LUCIO
     Carnally, she says.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Sirrah, no more!
LUCIO
     Enough, my lord.
ANGELO
     My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
     And five years since there was some speech of marriage
     Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
     Partly for that her promised proportions
     Came short of composition, but in chief
     For that her reputation was disvalued
     In levity: since which time of five years
     I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
     Upon my faith and honour.
MARIANA
     Noble prince,
     As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
     As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
     I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
     As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
     But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
     He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
     Let me in safety raise me from my knees
     Or else for ever be confixed here,
     A marble monument!
ANGELO
     I did but smile till now:
     Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
     My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
     These poor informal women are no more
     But instruments of some more mightier member
     That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
     To find this practise out.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Ay, with my heart
     And punish them to your height of pleasure.
     Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
     Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
     Though they would swear down each particular saint,
     Were testimonies against his worth and credit
     That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
     Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
     To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
     There is another friar that set them on;
     Let him be sent for.
FRIAR PETER
     Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
     Hath set the women on to this complaint:
     Your provost knows the place where he abides
     And he may fetch him.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Go do it instantly.
     Exit Provost
     And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
     Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
     Do with your injuries as seems you best,
     In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
     But stir not you till you have well determined
     Upon these slanderers.
ESCALUS
     My lord, we'll do it throughly.
     Exit DUKE
     Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
     Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
LUCIO
     'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
     but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
     villanous speeches of the duke.
ESCALUS
     We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
     enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
     notable fellow.
LUCIO
     As any in Vienna, on my word.
ESCALUS
     Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
     Exit an Attendant
     Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
     shall see how I'll handle her.
LUCIO
     Not better than he, by her own report.
ESCALUS
     Say you?
LUCIO
     Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
     she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
     she'll be ashamed.
ESCALUS
     I will go darkly to work with her.
LUCIO
     That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
     Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO
     in his friar's habit
ESCALUS
     Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
     that you have said.
LUCIO
     My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
     the provost.
ESCALUS
     In very good time: speak not you to him till we
     call upon you.
LUCIO
     Mum.
ESCALUS
     Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
     Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     'Tis false.
ESCALUS
     How! know you where you are?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Respect to your great place! and let the devil
     Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
     Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
ESCALUS
     The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
     Look you speak justly.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
     Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
     Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
     Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
     Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
     And put your trial in the villain's mouth
     Which here you come to accuse.
LUCIO
     This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
ESCALUS
     Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
     Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
     To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
     And in the witness of his proper ear,
     To call him villain? and then to glance from him
     To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
     Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
     Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
     What 'unjust'!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Be not so hot; the duke
     Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
     Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
     Nor here provincial. My business in this state
     Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
     Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
     Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
     But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
     Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
     As much in mock as mark.
ESCALUS
     Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
ANGELO
     What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
     Is this the man that you did tell us of?
LUCIO
     'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
     do you know me?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
     met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
LUCIO
     O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Most notedly, sir.
LUCIO
     Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
     fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
     that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
     much more, much worse.
LUCIO
     O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
     nose for thy speeches?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
ANGELO
     Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
     treasonable abuses!
ESCALUS
     Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
     him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
     to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
     speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
     with the other confederate companion!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     [To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.
ANGELO
     What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
LUCIO
     Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
     bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
     you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
     show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
     Will't not off?
     Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
     First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
     To LUCIO
     Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
     Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
LUCIO
     This may prove worse than hanging.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
     We'll borrow place of him.
     To ANGELO
     Sir, by your leave.
     Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
     That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
     Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
     And hold no longer out.
ANGELO
     O my dread lord,
     I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
     To think I can be undiscernible,
     When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
     Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
     No longer session hold upon my shame,
     But let my trial be mine own confession:
     Immediate sentence then and sequent death
     Is all the grace I beg.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Come hither, Mariana.
     Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
ANGELO
     I was, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
     Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
     Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
     Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost
ESCALUS
     My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
     Than at the strangeness of it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Come hither, Isabel.
     Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
     Advertising and holy to your business,
     Not changing heart with habit, I am still
     Attorney'd at your service.
ISABELLA
     O, give me pardon,
     That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
     Your unknown sovereignty!
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You are pardon'd, Isabel:
     And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
     Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
     And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
     Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
     Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
     Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
     It was the swift celerity of his death,
     Which I did think with slower foot came on,
     That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
     That life is better life, past fearing death,
     Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
     So happy is your brother.
ISABELLA
     I do, my lord.
     Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost
DUKE VINCENTIO
     For this new-married man approaching here,
     Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
     Your well defended honour, you must pardon
     For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
     Being criminal, in double violation
     Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
     Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
     The very mercy of the law cries out
     Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
     'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
     Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
     Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
     Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
     Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
     We do condemn thee to the very block
     Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
     Away with him!
MARIANA
     O my most gracious lord,
     I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
     Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
     I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
     For that he knew you, might reproach your life
     And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
     Although by confiscation they are ours,
     We do instate and widow you withal,
     To buy you a better husband.
MARIANA
     O my dear lord,
     I crave no other, nor no better man.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Never crave him; we are definitive.
MARIANA
     Gentle my liege,--
     Kneeling
DUKE VINCENTIO
     You do but lose your labour.
     Away with him to death!
     To LUCIO
     Now, sir, to you.
MARIANA
     O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
     Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
     I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Against all sense you do importune her:
     Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
     Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
     And take her hence in horror.
MARIANA
     Isabel,
     Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
     Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
     They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
     And, for the most, become much more the better
     For being a little bad: so may my husband.
     O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
DUKE VINCENTIO
     He dies for Claudio's death.
ISABELLA
     Most bounteous sir,
     Kneeling
     Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
     As if my brother lived: I partly think
     A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
     Till he did look on me: since it is so,
     Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
     In that he did the thing for which he died:
     For Angelo,
     His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
     And must be buried but as an intent
     That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
     Intents but merely thoughts.
MARIANA
     Merely, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
     I have bethought me of another fault.
     Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
     At an unusual hour?
Provost
     It was commanded so.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Had you a special warrant for the deed?
Provost
     No, my good lord; it was by private message.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     For which I do discharge you of your office:
     Give up your keys.
Provost
     Pardon me, noble lord:
     I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
     Yet did repent me, after more advice;
     For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
     That should by private order else have died,
     I have reserved alive.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     What's he?
Provost
     His name is Barnardine.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
     Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
     Exit Provost
ESCALUS
     I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
     As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
     Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
     And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
ANGELO
     I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
     And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
     That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
     'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
     Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Which is that Barnardine?
Provost
     This, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     There was a friar told me of this man.
     Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
     That apprehends no further than this world,
     And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
     But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
     And pray thee take this mercy to provide
     For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
     I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
Provost
     This is another prisoner that I saved.
     Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
     As like almost to Claudio as himself.
     Unmuffles CLAUDIO
DUKE VINCENTIO
     [To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
     Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
     Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
     He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
     By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
     Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
     Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
     Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
     I find an apt remission in myself;
     And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
     To LUCIO
     You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
     One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
     Wherein have I so deserved of you,
     That you extol me thus?
LUCIO
     'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
     trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
     had rather it would please you I might be whipt.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
     Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
     Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
     As I have heard him swear himself there's one
     Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
     And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
     Let him be whipt and hang'd.
LUCIO
     I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
     Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
     good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
     Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
     Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
     And see our pleasure herein executed.
LUCIO
     Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
     whipping, and hanging.
DUKE VINCENTIO
     Slandering a prince deserves it.
     Exit Officers with LUCIO
     She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
     Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
     I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
     Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
     There's more behind that is more gratulate.
     Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
     We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
     Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
     The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
     The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
     I have a motion much imports your good;
     Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
     What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
     So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
     What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
     Exeunt
