Twelfth Night
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace. ****
     Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending
DUKE ORSINO
     If music be the food of love, play on;
     Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
     The appetite may sicken, and so die.
     That strain again! it had a dying fall:
     O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
     That breathes upon a bank of violets,
     Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
     'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
     O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
     That, notwithstanding thy capacity
     Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
     Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
     But falls into abatement and low price,
     Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
     That it alone is high fantastical.
CURIO
     Will you go hunt, my lord?
DUKE ORSINO
     What, Curio?
CURIO
     The hart.
DUKE ORSINO
     Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
     O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
     Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
     That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
     And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
     E'er since pursue me.
     Enter VALENTINE
     How now! what news from her?
VALENTINE
     So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
     But from her handmaid do return this answer:
     The element itself, till seven years' heat,
     Shall not behold her face at ample view;
     But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
     And water once a day her chamber round
     With eye-offending brine: all this to season
     A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
     And lasting in her sad remembrance.
DUKE ORSINO
     O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
     To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
     How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
     Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
     That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
     These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
     Her sweet perfections with one self king!
     Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
     Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The sea-coast. ****
     Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors
VIOLA
     What country, friends, is this?
Captain
     This is Illyria, lady.
VIOLA
     And what should I do in Illyria?
     My brother he is in Elysium.
     Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
Captain
     It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
VIOLA
     O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
Captain
     True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
     Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
     When you and those poor number saved with you
     Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
     Most provident in peril, bind himself,
     Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
     To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
     Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
     I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
     So long as I could see.
VIOLA
     For saying so, there's gold:
     Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
     Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
     The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
Captain
     Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
     Not three hours' travel from this very place.
VIOLA
     Who governs here?
Captain
     A noble duke, in nature as in name.
VIOLA
     What is the name?
Captain
     Orsino.
VIOLA
     Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
     He was a bachelor then.
Captain
     And so is now, or was so very late;
     For but a month ago I went from hence,
     And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
     What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
     That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
VIOLA
     What's she?
Captain
     A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
     That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
     In the protection of his son, her brother,
     Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
     They say, she hath abjured the company
     And sight of men.
VIOLA
     O that I served that lady
     And might not be delivered to the world,
     Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
     What my estate is!
Captain
     That were hard to compass;
     Because she will admit no kind of suit,
     No, not the duke's.
VIOLA
     There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
     And though that nature with a beauteous wall
     Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
     I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
     With this thy fair and outward character.
     I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
     Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
     For such disguise as haply shall become
     The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
     Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
     It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
     And speak to him in many sorts of music
     That will allow me very worth his service.
     What else may hap to time I will commit;
     Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Captain
     Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
     When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
VIOLA
     I thank thee: lead me on.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house. ****
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
     her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
MARIA
     By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
     nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
     exceptions to your ill hours.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Why, let her except, before excepted.
MARIA
     Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
     limits of order.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
     these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
     these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
     themselves in their own straps.
MARIA
     That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
     my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
     knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
MARIA
     Ay, he.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
MARIA
     What's that to the purpose?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
MARIA
     Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
     he's a very fool and a prodigal.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
     viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
     word for word without book, and hath all the good
     gifts of nature.
MARIA
     He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
     he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
     he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
     hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
     he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
     that say so of him. Who are they?
MARIA
     They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
     her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
     drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
     that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
     o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
     Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
     Enter SIR ANDREW
SIR ANDREW
     Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Sweet Sir Andrew!
SIR ANDREW
     Bless you, fair shrew.
MARIA
     And you too, sir.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
SIR ANDREW
     What's that?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     My niece's chambermaid.
SIR ANDREW
     Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
MARIA
     My name is Mary, sir.
SIR ANDREW
     Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
     her, woo her, assail her.
SIR ANDREW
     By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
     company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
MARIA
     Fare you well, gentlemen.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
     never draw sword again.
SIR ANDREW
     An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
     draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
     fools in hand?
MARIA
     Sir, I have not you by the hand.
SIR ANDREW
     Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
MARIA
     Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
     your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
SIR ANDREW
     Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
MARIA
     It's dry, sir.
SIR ANDREW
     Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
     keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
MARIA
     A dry jest, sir.
SIR ANDREW
     Are you full of them?
MARIA
     Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
     now I let go your hand, I am barren.
     Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
     O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
     see thee so put down?
SIR ANDREW
     Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
     put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
     than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
     great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     No question.
SIR ANDREW
     An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
     to-morrow, Sir Toby.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Pourquoi, my dear knight?
SIR ANDREW
     What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
     bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
     fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
     followed the arts!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
SIR ANDREW
     Why, would that have mended my hair?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
SIR ANDREW
     But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
     hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
     and spin it off.
SIR ANDREW
     Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
     will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
     she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
     her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
     have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
     man.
SIR ANDREW
     I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
     strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
     and revels sometimes altogether.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
SIR ANDREW
     As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
     degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
     with an old man.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
SIR ANDREW
     Faith, I can cut a caper.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     And I can cut the mutton to't.
SIR ANDREW
     And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
     as any man in Illyria.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
     these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
     take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
     thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
     a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
     so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
     dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
     I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
     leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
SIR ANDREW
     Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
     flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
SIR ANDREW
     Taurus! That's sides and heart.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
     caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace. ****
     Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire
VALENTINE
     If the duke continue these favours towards you,
     Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
     known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
VIOLA
     You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
     you call in question the continuance of his love:
     is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
VALENTINE
     No, believe me.
VIOLA
     I thank you. Here comes the count.
     Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants
DUKE ORSINO
     Who saw Cesario, ho?
VIOLA
     On your attendance, my lord; here.
DUKE ORSINO
     Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
     Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
     To thee the book even of my secret soul:
     Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
     Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
     And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
     Till thou have audience.
VIOLA
     Sure, my noble lord,
     If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
     As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
DUKE ORSINO
     Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
     Rather than make unprofited return.
VIOLA
     Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
DUKE ORSINO
     O, then unfold the passion of my love,
     Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
     It shall become thee well to act my woes;
     She will attend it better in thy youth
     Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
VIOLA
     I think not so, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
     Dear lad, believe it;
     For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
     That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
     Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
     Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
     And all is semblative a woman's part.
     I know thy constellation is right apt
     For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
     All, if you will; for I myself am best
     When least in company. Prosper well in this,
     And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
     To call his fortunes thine.
VIOLA
     I'll do my best
     To woo your lady:
     Aside
     yet, a barful strife!
     Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house. ****
     Enter MARIA and Clown
MARIA
     Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
     not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
     way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Clown
     Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
     world needs to fear no colours.
MARIA
     Make that good.
Clown
     He shall see none to fear.
MARIA
     A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
     saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
Clown
     Where, good Mistress Mary?
MARIA
     In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Clown
     Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
     that are fools, let them use their talents.
MARIA
     Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
     to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
Clown
     Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
     for turning away, let summer bear it out.
MARIA
     You are resolute, then?
Clown
     Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
MARIA
     That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
     break, your gaskins fall.
Clown
     Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
     Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
     piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
MARIA
     Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
     lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
     Exit
Clown
     Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
     Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
     prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
     pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
     'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
     Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
     God bless thee, lady!
OLIVIA
     Take the fool away.
Clown
     Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
OLIVIA
     Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
     besides, you grow dishonest.
Clown
     Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
     will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
     the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
     himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
     he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
     that's mended is but patched: virtue that
     transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
     amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
     simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
     what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
     calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
     away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
OLIVIA
     Sir, I bade them take away you.
Clown
     Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
     facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
     motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
     prove you a fool.
OLIVIA
     Can you do it?
Clown
     Dexterously, good madonna.
OLIVIA
     Make your proof.
Clown
     I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
     of virtue, answer me.
OLIVIA
     Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
Clown
     Good madonna, why mournest thou?
OLIVIA
     Good fool, for my brother's death.
Clown
     I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
OLIVIA
     I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
Clown
     The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
     soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
OLIVIA
     What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
MALVOLIO
     Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
     infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
     better fool.
Clown
     God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
     better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
     sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
     word for two pence that you are no fool.
OLIVIA
     How say you to that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
     I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
     barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
     with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
     than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
     already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
     him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
     that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
     than the fools' zanies.
OLIVIA
     Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
     with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
     guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
     things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
     there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
     nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
     man, though he do nothing but reprove.
Clown
     Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
     speakest well of fools!
     Re-enter MARIA
MARIA
     Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
     desires to speak with you.
OLIVIA
     From the Count Orsino, is it?
MARIA
     I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
OLIVIA
     Who of my people hold him in delay?
MARIA
     Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
OLIVIA
     Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
     madman: fie on him!
     Exit MARIA
     Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
     am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
     Exit MALVOLIO
     Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
     people dislike it.
Clown
     Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
     son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
     brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
     most weak pia mater.
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH
OLIVIA
     By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     A gentleman.
OLIVIA
     A gentleman! what gentleman?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
     pickle-herring! How now, sot!
Clown
     Good Sir Toby!
OLIVIA
     Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
OLIVIA
     Ay, marry, what is he?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
     me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
     Exit
OLIVIA
     What's a drunken man like, fool?
Clown
     Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
     draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
     him; and a third drowns him.
OLIVIA
     Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
     coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
     drowned: go, look after him.
Clown
     He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
     to the madman.
     Exit
     Re-enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
     Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
     you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
     understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
     with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
     have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
     comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
     lady? he's fortified against any denial.
OLIVIA
     Tell him he shall not speak with me.
MALVOLIO
     Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
     door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
     a bench, but he'll speak with you.
OLIVIA
     What kind o' man is he?
MALVOLIO
     Why, of mankind.
OLIVIA
     What manner of man?
MALVOLIO
     Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
OLIVIA
     Of what personage and years is he?
MALVOLIO
     Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
     a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
     cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
     in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
     well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
     would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
OLIVIA
     Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
MALVOLIO
     Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
     Exit
     Re-enter MARIA
OLIVIA
     Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
     We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
     Enter VIOLA, and Attendants
VIOLA
     The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
OLIVIA
     Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
     Your will?
VIOLA
     Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
     pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
     for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
     my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
     penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
     beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
     comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
OLIVIA
     Whence came you, sir?
VIOLA
     I can say little more than I have studied, and that
     question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
     modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
     that I may proceed in my speech.
OLIVIA
     Are you a comedian?
VIOLA
     No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
     of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
     the lady of the house?
OLIVIA
     If I do not usurp myself, I am.
VIOLA
     Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
     yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
     to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
     on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
     the heart of my message.
OLIVIA
     Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
VIOLA
     Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
OLIVIA
     It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
     keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
     and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
     than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
     you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
     moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
MARIA
     Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
VIOLA
     No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
     longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
     lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
OLIVIA
     Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
     the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
VIOLA
     It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
     war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
     hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
OLIVIA
     Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
VIOLA
     The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
     learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
     would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
     divinity, to any other's, profanation.
OLIVIA
     Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
     Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
     Now, sir, what is your text?
VIOLA
     Most sweet lady,--
OLIVIA
     A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
     Where lies your text?
VIOLA
     In Orsino's bosom.
OLIVIA
     In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
VIOLA
     To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
OLIVIA
     O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
VIOLA
     Good madam, let me see your face.
OLIVIA
     Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
     with my face? You are now out of your text: but
     we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
     Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
     not well done?
     Unveiling
VIOLA
     Excellently done, if God did all.
OLIVIA
     'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
VIOLA
     'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
     Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
     Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
     If you will lead these graces to the grave
     And leave the world no copy.
OLIVIA
     O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
     out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
     inventoried, and every particle and utensil
     labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
     indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
     them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
     you sent hither to praise me?
VIOLA
     I see you what you are, you are too proud;
     But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
     My lord and master loves you: O, such love
     Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
     The nonpareil of beauty!
OLIVIA
     How does he love me?
VIOLA
     With adorations, fertile tears,
     With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
OLIVIA
     Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
     Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
     Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
     In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
     And in dimension and the shape of nature
     A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
     He might have took his answer long ago.
VIOLA
     If I did love you in my master's flame,
     With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
     In your denial I would find no sense;
     I would not understand it.
OLIVIA
     Why, what would you?
VIOLA
     Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
     And call upon my soul within the house;
     Write loyal cantons of contemned love
     And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
     Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
     And make the babbling gossip of the air
     Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
     Between the elements of air and earth,
     But you should pity me!
OLIVIA
     You might do much.
     What is your parentage?
VIOLA
     Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
     I am a gentleman.
OLIVIA
     Get you to your lord;
     I cannot love him: let him send no more;
     Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
     To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
     I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
VIOLA
     I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
     My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
     Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
     And let your fervor, like my master's, be
     Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
     Exit
OLIVIA
     'What is your parentage?'
     'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
     I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
     Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
     Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
     soft, soft!
     Unless the master were the man. How now!
     Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
     Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
     With an invisible and subtle stealth
     To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
     What ho, Malvolio!
     Re-enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
     Here, madam, at your service.
OLIVIA
     Run after that same peevish messenger,
     The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
     Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
     Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
     Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
     If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
     I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
MALVOLIO
     Madam, I will.
     Exit
OLIVIA
     I do I know not what, and fear to find
     Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
     Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
     What is decreed must be, and be this so.
     Exit
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. The sea-coast. ****
     Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
ANTONIO
     Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
SEBASTIAN
     By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
     me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
     distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
     leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
     recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
     ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
SEBASTIAN
     No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
     extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
     touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
     what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
     me in manners the rather to express myself. You
     must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
     which I called Roderigo. My father was that
     Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
     of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
     born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
     would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
     for some hour before you took me from the breach of
     the sea was my sister drowned.
ANTONIO
     Alas the day!
SEBASTIAN
     A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
     me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
     though I could not with such estimable wonder
     overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
     publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
     call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
     water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
ANTONIO
     Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
SEBASTIAN
     O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
ANTONIO
     If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
     your servant.
SEBASTIAN
     If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
     kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
     Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
     and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
     upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
     tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
     Exit
ANTONIO
     The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
     I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
     Else would I very shortly see thee there.
     But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
     That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. A street. ****
     Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following
MALVOLIO
     Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
VIOLA
     Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
     arrived but hither.
MALVOLIO
     She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
     saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
     She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
     into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
     and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
     come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
     your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
VIOLA
     She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
MALVOLIO
     Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
     will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
     stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
     it his that finds it.
     Exit
VIOLA
     I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
     Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
     She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
     That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
     For she did speak in starts distractedly.
     She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
     Invites me in this churlish messenger.
     None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
     I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
     Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
     Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
     Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
     How easy is it for the proper-false
     In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
     Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
     For such as we are made of, such we be.
     How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
     And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
     And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
     What will become of this? As I am man,
     My state is desperate for my master's love;
     As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
     What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
     O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
     It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
     Exit
**** SCENE III. OLIVIA's house. ****
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
     midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
     surgere,' thou know'st,--
SIR ANDREW
     Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
     late is to be up late.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
     To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
     early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
     to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
     four elements?
SIR ANDREW
     Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
     of eating and drinking.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
     Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
     Enter Clown
SIR ANDREW
     Here comes the fool, i' faith.
Clown
     How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
     of 'we three'?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
SIR ANDREW
     By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
     had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
     and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
     sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
     night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
     Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
     very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
     leman: hadst it?
Clown
     I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
     is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
     Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
SIR ANDREW
     Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
     is done. Now, a song.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
SIR ANDREW
     There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
Clown
     Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     A love-song, a love-song.
SIR ANDREW
     Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
Clown
     [Sings]
     O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
     O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
     That can sing both high and low:
     Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
     Journeys end in lovers meeting,
     Every wise man's son doth know.
SIR ANDREW
     Excellent good, i' faith.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Good, good.
Clown
     [Sings]
     What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
     Present mirth hath present laughter;
     What's to come is still unsure:
     In delay there lies no plenty;
     Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
     Youth's a stuff will not endure.
SIR ANDREW
     A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     A contagious breath.
SIR ANDREW
     Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
     But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
     rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
     souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
SIR ANDREW
     An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
Clown
     By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
SIR ANDREW
     Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
Clown
     'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
     constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
SIR ANDREW
     'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
     call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
Clown
     I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
SIR ANDREW
     Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
     Catch sung
     Enter MARIA
MARIA
     What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
     have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
     turn you out of doors, never trust me.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
     a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
     I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
     Tillyvally. Lady!
     Sings
     'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
Clown
     Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
SIR ANDREW
     Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
     I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
     more natural.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
MARIA
     For the love o' God, peace!
     Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
     My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
     no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
     tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
     alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
     coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
     of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
     time in you?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
MALVOLIO
     Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
     tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
     kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
     you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
     are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
     you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
     you farewell.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
MARIA
     Nay, good Sir Toby.
Clown
     'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
MALVOLIO
     Is't even so?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     'But I will never die.'
Clown
     Sir Toby, there you lie.
MALVOLIO
     This is much credit to you.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     'Shall I bid him go?'
Clown
     'What an if you do?'
SIR TOBY BELCH
     'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
Clown
     'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
     steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
     virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
Clown
     Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
     mouth too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
     crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
MALVOLIO
     Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
     thing more than contempt, you would not give means
     for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
     Exit
MARIA
     Go shake your ears.
SIR ANDREW
     'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
     a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
     break promise with him and make a fool of him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
     deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
MARIA
     Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
     youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
     much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
     alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
     nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
     think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
     I know I can do it.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
MARIA
     Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
SIR ANDREW
     O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
     dear knight?
SIR ANDREW
     I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
     good enough.
MARIA
     The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
     constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
     that cons state without book and utters it by great
     swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
     crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
     his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
     him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
     notable cause to work.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What wilt thou do?
MARIA
     I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
     love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
     of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
     of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
     himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
     like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
     can hardly make distinction of our hands.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Excellent! I smell a device.
SIR ANDREW
     I have't in my nose too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
     that they come from my niece, and that she's in
     love with him.
MARIA
     My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
SIR ANDREW
     And your horse now would make him an ass.
MARIA
     Ass, I doubt not.
SIR ANDREW
     O, 'twill be admirable!
MARIA
     Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
     work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
     fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
     observe his construction of it. For this night, to
     bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
     Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Good night, Penthesilea.
SIR ANDREW
     Before me, she's a good wench.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
     what o' that?
SIR ANDREW
     I was adored once too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
     more money.
SIR ANDREW
     If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
     the end, call me cut.
SIR ANDREW
     If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
     to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace. ****
     Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others
DUKE ORSINO
     Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
     Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
     That old and antique song we heard last night:
     Methought it did relieve my passion much,
     More than light airs and recollected terms
     Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
     Come, but one verse.
CURIO
     He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
DUKE ORSINO
     Who was it?
CURIO
     Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
     Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
DUKE ORSINO
     Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
     Exit CURIO. Music plays
     Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
     In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
     For such as I am all true lovers are,
     Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
     Save in the constant image of the creature
     That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
VIOLA
     It gives a very echo to the seat
     Where Love is throned.
DUKE ORSINO
     Thou dost speak masterly:
     My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
     Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
     Hath it not, boy?
VIOLA
     A little, by your favour.
DUKE ORSINO
     What kind of woman is't?
VIOLA
     Of your complexion.
DUKE ORSINO
     She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
VIOLA
     About your years, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
     Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
     An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
     So sways she level in her husband's heart:
     For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
     Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
     More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
     Than women's are.
VIOLA
     I think it well, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
     Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
     Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
     For women are as roses, whose fair flower
     Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
VIOLA
     And so they are: alas, that they are so;
     To die, even when they to perfection grow!
     Re-enter CURIO and Clown
DUKE ORSINO
     O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
     Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
     The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
     And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
     Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
     And dallies with the innocence of love,
     Like the old age.
Clown
     Are you ready, sir?
DUKE ORSINO
     Ay; prithee, sing.
     Music
     SONG.
Clown
     Come away, come away, death,
     And in sad cypress let me be laid;
     Fly away, fly away breath;
     I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
     My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
     O, prepare it!
     My part of death, no one so true
     Did share it.
     Not a flower, not a flower sweet
     On my black coffin let there be strown;
     Not a friend, not a friend greet
     My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
     A thousand thousand sighs to save,
     Lay me, O, where
     Sad true lover never find my grave,
     To weep there!
DUKE ORSINO
     There's for thy pains.
Clown
     No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
DUKE ORSINO
     I'll pay thy pleasure then.
Clown
     Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
DUKE ORSINO
     Give me now leave to leave thee.
Clown
     Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
     tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
     thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
     constancy put to sea, that their business might be
     every thing and their intent every where; for that's
     it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
     Exit
DUKE ORSINO
     Let all the rest give place.
     CURIO and Attendants retire
     Once more, Cesario,
     Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
     Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
     Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
     The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
     Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
     But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
     That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
VIOLA
     But if she cannot love you, sir?
DUKE ORSINO
     I cannot be so answer'd.
VIOLA
     Sooth, but you must.
     Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
     Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
     As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
     You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
DUKE ORSINO
     There is no woman's sides
     Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
     As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
     So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
     Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
     No motion of the liver, but the palate,
     That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
     But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
     And can digest as much: make no compare
     Between that love a woman can bear me
     And that I owe Olivia.
VIOLA
     Ay, but I know--
DUKE ORSINO
     What dost thou know?
VIOLA
     Too well what love women to men may owe:
     In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
     My father had a daughter loved a man,
     As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
     I should your lordship.
DUKE ORSINO
     And what's her history?
VIOLA
     A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
     But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
     Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
     And with a green and yellow melancholy
     She sat like patience on a monument,
     Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
     We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
     Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
     Much in our vows, but little in our love.
DUKE ORSINO
     But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
VIOLA
     I am all the daughters of my father's house,
     And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
     Sir, shall I to this lady?
DUKE ORSINO
     Ay, that's the theme.
     To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
     My love can give no place, bide no denay.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden. ****
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
FABIAN
     Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
     let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
     rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
FABIAN
     I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
     favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
     fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
SIR ANDREW
     An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Here comes the little villain.
     Enter MARIA
     How now, my metal of India!
MARIA
     Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
     coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
     sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
     hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
     know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
     him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
     Throws down a letter
     for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
     Exit
     Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO
     'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
     me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
     thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
     of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
     exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
     What should I think on't?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Here's an overweening rogue!
FABIAN
     O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
     of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
SIR ANDREW
     'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Peace, I say.
MALVOLIO
     To be Count Malvolio!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Ah, rogue!
SIR ANDREW
     Pistol him, pistol him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Peace, peace!
MALVOLIO
     There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
     married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
SIR ANDREW
     Fie on him, Jezebel!
FABIAN
     O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
     imagination blows him.
MALVOLIO
     Having been three months married to her, sitting in
     my state,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
MALVOLIO
     Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
     gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
     Olivia sleeping,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Fire and brimstone!
FABIAN
     O, peace, peace!
MALVOLIO
     And then to have the humour of state; and after a
     demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
     place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
     kinsman Toby,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Bolts and shackles!
FABIAN
     O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
MALVOLIO
     Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
     out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
     up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
     approaches; courtesies there to me,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Shall this fellow live?
FABIAN
     Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
MALVOLIO
     I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
     smile with an austere regard of control,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
MALVOLIO
     Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
     your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What, what?
MALVOLIO
     'You must amend your drunkenness.'
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Out, scab!
FABIAN
     Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
MALVOLIO
     'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
     a foolish knight,'--
SIR ANDREW
     That's me, I warrant you.
MALVOLIO
     'One Sir Andrew,'--
SIR ANDREW
     I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
MALVOLIO
     What employment have we here?
     Taking up the letter
FABIAN
     Now is the woodcock near the gin.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
     aloud to him!
MALVOLIO
     By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
     very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
     great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
SIR ANDREW
     Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
MALVOLIO
     [Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
     wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
     Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
     uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
FABIAN
     This wins him, liver and all.
MALVOLIO
     [Reads]
     Jove knows I love: But who?
     Lips, do not move;
     No man must know.
     'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
     altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
     thee, Malvolio?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Marry, hang thee, brock!
MALVOLIO
     [Reads]
     I may command where I adore;
     But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
     With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
     M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
FABIAN
     A fustian riddle!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Excellent wench, say I.
MALVOLIO
     'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
     me see, let me see, let me see.
FABIAN
     What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
MALVOLIO
     'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
     me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
     evident to any formal capacity; there is no
     obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
     that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
     that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
     I,--
SIR TOBY BELCH
     O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
FABIAN
     Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
     rank as a fox.
MALVOLIO
     M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
FABIAN
     Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
     excellent at faults.
MALVOLIO
     M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
     that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
FABIAN
     And O shall end, I hope.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
MALVOLIO
     And then I comes behind.
FABIAN
     Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
     more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
     you.
MALVOLIO
     M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
     yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
     every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
     here follows prose.
     Reads
     'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
     am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
     are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
     have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
     their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
     and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
     cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
     opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
     thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
     the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
     that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
     yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
     cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
     made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
     thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
     not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
     She that would alter services with thee,
     THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
     Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
     open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
     I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
     acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
     I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
     me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
     loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
     late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
     and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
     with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
     of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
     be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
     cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
     on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
     postscript.
     Reads
     'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
     entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
     thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
     presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
     Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
     everything that thou wilt have me.
     Exit
FABIAN
     I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
     of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I could marry this wench for this device.
SIR ANDREW
     So could I too.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
SIR ANDREW
     Nor I neither.
FABIAN
     Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
     Re-enter MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
SIR ANDREW
     Or o' mine either?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
     bond-slave?
SIR ANDREW
     I' faith, or I either?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
     the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
MARIA
     Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
MARIA
     If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
     his first approach before my lady: he will come to
     her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
     abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
     and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
     unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
     melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
     into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
     me.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
SIR ANDREW
     I'll make one too.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden. ****
     Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour
VIOLA
     Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
     thy tabour?
Clown
     No, sir, I live by the church.
VIOLA
     Art thou a churchman?
Clown
     No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
     I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
     the church.
VIOLA
     So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
     beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
     tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
Clown
     You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
     but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
     wrong side may be turned outward!
VIOLA
     Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
     words may quickly make them wanton.
Clown
     I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
VIOLA
     Why, man?
Clown
     Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
     word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
     are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
VIOLA
     Thy reason, man?
Clown
     Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
     words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
     reason with them.
VIOLA
     I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Clown
     Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
     conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
     to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
VIOLA
     Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
Clown
     No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
     will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
     fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
     herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
     her fool, but her corrupter of words.
VIOLA
     I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
Clown
     Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
     it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
     the fool should be as oft with your master as with
     my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
VIOLA
     Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
     Hold, there's expenses for thee.
Clown
     Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
VIOLA
     By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
     one;
     Aside
     though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
     lady within?
Clown
     Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
VIOLA
     Yes, being kept together and put to use.
Clown
     I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
     a Cressida to this Troilus.
VIOLA
     I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
Clown
     The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
     a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
     within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
     come; who you are and what you would are out of my
     welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
     Exit
VIOLA
     This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
     And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
     He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
     The quality of persons, and the time,
     And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
     That comes before his eye. This is a practise
     As full of labour as a wise man's art
     For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
     But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Save you, gentleman.
VIOLA
     And you, sir.
SIR ANDREW
     Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
VIOLA
     Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
SIR ANDREW
     I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
     you should enter, if your trade be to her.
VIOLA
     I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
     list of my voyage.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
VIOLA
     My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
     understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
VIOLA
     I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
     are prevented.
     Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
     Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
     odours on you!
SIR ANDREW
     That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.
VIOLA
     My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
     and vouchsafed ear.
SIR ANDREW
     'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
     all three all ready.
OLIVIA
     Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
     Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA
     Give me your hand, sir.
VIOLA
     My duty, madam, and most humble service.
OLIVIA
     What is your name?
VIOLA
     Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
OLIVIA
     My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
     Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
     You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
VIOLA
     And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
     Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
OLIVIA
     For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
     Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
VIOLA
     Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
     On his behalf.
OLIVIA
     O, by your leave, I pray you,
     I bade you never speak again of him:
     But, would you undertake another suit,
     I had rather hear you to solicit that
     Than music from the spheres.
VIOLA
     Dear lady,--
OLIVIA
     Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
     After the last enchantment you did here,
     A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
     Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
     Under your hard construction must I sit,
     To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
     Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
     Have you not set mine honour at the stake
     And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
     That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
     Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
     Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
VIOLA
     I pity you.
OLIVIA
     That's a degree to love.
VIOLA
     No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
     That very oft we pity enemies.
OLIVIA
     Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
     O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
     If one should be a prey, how much the better
     To fall before the lion than the wolf!
     Clock strikes
     The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
     Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
     And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
     Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
     There lies your way, due west.
VIOLA
     Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
     Attend your ladyship!
     You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
OLIVIA
     Stay:
     I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
VIOLA
     That you do think you are not what you are.
OLIVIA
     If I think so, I think the same of you.
VIOLA
     Then think you right: I am not what I am.
OLIVIA
     I would you were as I would have you be!
VIOLA
     Would it be better, madam, than I am?
     I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
OLIVIA
     O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
     In the contempt and anger of his lip!
     A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
     Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
     Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
     By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
     I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
     Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
     Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
     For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
     But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
     Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
VIOLA
     By innocence I swear, and by my youth
     I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
     And that no woman has; nor never none
     Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
     And so adieu, good madam: never more
     Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
OLIVIA
     Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
     That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. OLIVIA's house. ****
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
SIR ANDREW
     No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
FABIAN
     You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
SIR ANDREW
     Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
     count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
     I saw't i' the orchard.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
SIR ANDREW
     As plain as I see you now.
FABIAN
     This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
SIR ANDREW
     'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
FABIAN
     I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
     judgment and reason.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
     was a sailor.
FABIAN
     She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
     to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
     put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
     You should then have accosted her; and with some
     excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
     have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
     looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
     double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
     off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
     lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
     on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
     some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
SIR ANDREW
     An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
     I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
     politician.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
     valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
     with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
     take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
     love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
     commendation with woman than report of valour.
FABIAN
     There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
SIR ANDREW
     Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
     it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
     of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
     if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
     amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
     paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
     bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
     Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
     write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
SIR ANDREW
     Where shall I find you?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
     Exit SIR ANDREW
FABIAN
     This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
     strong, or so.
FABIAN
     We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
     not deliver't?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
     youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
     cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
     opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
     will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
     the anatomy.
FABIAN
     And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
     great presage of cruelty.
     Enter MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
MARIA
     If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
     into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
     turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
     Christian, that means to be saved by believing
     rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
     of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     And cross-gartered?
MARIA
     Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
     i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
     murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
     that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
     face into more lines than is in the new map with the
     augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
     a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
     at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
     he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. A street. ****
     Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
SEBASTIAN
     I would not by my will have troubled you;
     But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
     I will no further chide you.
ANTONIO
     I could not stay behind you: my desire,
     More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
     And not all love to see you, though so much
     As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
     But jealousy what might befall your travel,
     Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
     Unguided and unfriended, often prove
     Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
     The rather by these arguments of fear,
     Set forth in your pursuit.
SEBASTIAN
     My kind Antonio,
     I can no other answer make but thanks,
     And thanks; and ever [ ] oft good turns
     Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
     But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
     You should find better dealing. What's to do?
     Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
ANTONIO
     To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
SEBASTIAN
     I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
     I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
     With the memorials and the things of fame
     That do renown this city.
ANTONIO
     Would you'ld pardon me;
     I do not without danger walk these streets:
     Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
     I did some service; of such note indeed,
     That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
SEBASTIAN
     Belike you slew great number of his people.
ANTONIO
     The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
     Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
     Might well have given us bloody argument.
     It might have since been answer'd in repaying
     What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
     Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
     For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
     I shall pay dear.
SEBASTIAN
     Do not then walk too open.
ANTONIO
     It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
     In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
     Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
     Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
     With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
SEBASTIAN
     Why I your purse?
ANTONIO
     Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
     You have desire to purchase; and your store,
     I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
SEBASTIAN
     I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
     For an hour.
ANTONIO
     To the Elephant.
SEBASTIAN
     I do remember.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden. ****
     Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
OLIVIA
     I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
     How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
     For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
     I speak too loud.
     Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
     And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
     Where is Malvolio?
MARIA
     He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
     is, sure, possessed, madam.
OLIVIA
     Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
MARIA
     No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
     ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
     he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
OLIVIA
     Go call him hither.
     Exit MARIA
     I am as mad as he,
     If sad and merry madness equal be.
     Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO
     How now, Malvolio!
MALVOLIO
     Sweet lady, ho, ho.
OLIVIA
     Smilest thou?
     I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
MALVOLIO
     Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
     obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
     what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
     with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
     please all.'
OLIVIA
     Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
MALVOLIO
     Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
     did come to his hands, and commands shall be
     executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
OLIVIA
     Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
     To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
OLIVIA
     God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
     thy hand so oft?
MARIA
     How do you, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
     At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
MARIA
     Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
MALVOLIO
     'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
OLIVIA
     What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
     'Some are born great,'--
OLIVIA
     Ha!
MALVOLIO
     'Some achieve greatness,'--
OLIVIA
     What sayest thou?
MALVOLIO
     'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
OLIVIA
     Heaven restore thee!
MALVOLIO
     'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--
OLIVIA
     Thy yellow stockings!
MALVOLIO
     'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
OLIVIA
     Cross-gartered!
MALVOLIO
     'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--
OLIVIA
     Am I made?
MALVOLIO
     'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
OLIVIA
     Why, this is very midsummer madness.
     Enter Servant
Servant
     Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
     returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
     attends your ladyship's pleasure.
OLIVIA
     I'll come to him.
     Exit Servant
     Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
     my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
     care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
     half of my dowry.
     Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
MALVOLIO
     O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
     Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
     the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
     appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
     in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
     'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
     let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
     thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
     consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
     face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
     habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
     limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
     thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
     fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
     after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
     adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
     scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
     or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
     that can be can come between me and the full
     prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
     doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
     Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
     the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
     himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
FABIAN
     Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
     how is't with you, man?
MALVOLIO
     Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
     off.
MARIA
     Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
     I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
     care of him.
MALVOLIO
     Ah, ha! does she so?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
     with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
     is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
     consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
MALVOLIO
     Do you know what you say?
MARIA
     La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
     it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
FABIAN
     Carry his water to the wise woman.
MARIA
     Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
     live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
MALVOLIO
     How now, mistress!
MARIA
     O Lord!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
     you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
FABIAN
     No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
     rough, and will not be roughly used.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
MALVOLIO
     Sir!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
     gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
     him, foul collier!
MARIA
     Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
MALVOLIO
     My prayers, minx!
MARIA
     No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
MALVOLIO
     Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
     things: I am not of your element: you shall know
     more hereafter.
     Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Is't possible?
FABIAN
     If this were played upon a stage now, I could
     condemn it as an improbable fiction.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
MARIA
     Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
FABIAN
     Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
MARIA
     The house will be the quieter.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
     niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
     may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
     till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
     us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
     bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
     finder of madmen. But see, but see.
     Enter SIR ANDREW
FABIAN
     More matter for a May morning.
SIR ANDREW
     Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
     vinegar and pepper in't.
FABIAN
     Is't so saucy?
SIR ANDREW
     Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Give me.
     Reads
     'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
FABIAN
     Good, and valiant.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
     why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
FABIAN
     A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
     sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
     throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
FABIAN
     Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
     be thy chance to kill me,'--
FABIAN
     Good.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
FABIAN
     Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
     one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
     my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
     friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
     ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
     If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
     I'll give't him.
MARIA
     You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
     some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
     orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
     him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
     it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
     swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
     more approbation than ever proof itself would have
     earned him. Away!
SIR ANDREW
     Nay, let me alone for swearing.
     Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
     of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
     capacity and breeding; his employment between his
     lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
     letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
     terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
     clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
     word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
     of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
     youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
     opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
     This will so fright them both that they will kill
     one another by the look, like cockatrices.
     Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA
FABIAN
     Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
     he take leave, and presently after him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
     for a challenge.
     Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA
OLIVIA
     I have said too much unto a heart of stone
     And laid mine honour too unchary out:
     There's something in me that reproves my fault;
     But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
     That it but mocks reproof.
VIOLA
     With the same 'havior that your passion bears
     Goes on my master's grief.
OLIVIA
     Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
     Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
     And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
     What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
     That honour saved may upon asking give?
VIOLA
     Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
OLIVIA
     How with mine honour may I give him that
     Which I have given to you?
VIOLA
     I will acquit you.
OLIVIA
     Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
     A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
     Exit
     Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Gentleman, God save thee.
VIOLA
     And you, sir.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
     nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
     not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
     the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
     dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
     thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
VIOLA
     You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
     to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
     any image of offence done to any man.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
     if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
     your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
     youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
VIOLA
     I pray you, sir, what is he?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
     carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
     brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
     his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
     that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
     and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
VIOLA
     I will return again into the house and desire some
     conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
     of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
     others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
     of that quirk.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
     very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
     give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
     house, unless you undertake that with me which with
     as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
     or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
     must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
VIOLA
     This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
     this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
     my offence to him is: it is something of my
     negligence, nothing of my purpose.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
     gentleman till my return.
     Exit
VIOLA
     Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
FABIAN
     I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
     mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
VIOLA
     I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
FABIAN
     Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
     his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
     of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
     bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
     have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
     towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
     can.
VIOLA
     I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
     had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
     care not who knows so much of my mettle.
     Exeunt
     Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
     firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
     all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
     motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
     pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
     step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
SIR ANDREW
     Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
     scarce hold him yonder.
SIR ANDREW
     Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
     cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
     have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
     and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
     on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
     Aside
     Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
     Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA
     To FABIAN
     I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
     I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
FABIAN
     He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
     looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     [To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
     with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
     bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
     scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
     the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
VIOLA
     [Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
     make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
FABIAN
     Give ground, if you see him furious.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
     will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
     he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
     promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
     will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
SIR ANDREW
     Pray God, he keep his oath!
VIOLA
     I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
     They draw
     Enter ANTONIO
ANTONIO
     Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
     Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
     If you offend him, I for him defy you.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     You, sir! why, what are you?
ANTONIO
     One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
     Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
     They draw
     Enter Officers
FABIAN
     O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I'll be with you anon.
VIOLA
     Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
SIR ANDREW
     Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
     I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
     and reins well.
First Officer
     This is the man; do thy office.
Second Officer
     Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
ANTONIO
     You do mistake me, sir.
First Officer
     No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
     Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
     Take him away: he knows I know him well.
ANTONIO
     I must obey.
     To VIOLA
     This comes with seeking you:
     But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
     What will you do, now my necessity
     Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
     Much more for what I cannot do for you
     Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
     But be of comfort.
Second Officer
     Come, sir, away.
ANTONIO
     I must entreat of you some of that money.
VIOLA
     What money, sir?
     For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
     And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
     Out of my lean and low ability
     I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
     I'll make division of my present with you:
     Hold, there's half my coffer.
ANTONIO
     Will you deny me now?
     Is't possible that my deserts to you
     Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
     Lest that it make me so unsound a man
     As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
     That I have done for you.
VIOLA
     I know of none;
     Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
     I hate ingratitude more in a man
     Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
     Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
     Inhabits our frail blood.
ANTONIO
     O heavens themselves!
Second Officer
     Come, sir, I pray you, go.
ANTONIO
     Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
     I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
     Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
     And to his image, which methought did promise
     Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
First Officer
     What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
ANTONIO
     But O how vile an idol proves this god
     Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
     In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
     None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
     Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
     Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
First Officer
     The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
ANTONIO
     Lead me on.
     Exit with Officers
VIOLA
     Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
     That he believes himself: so do not I.
     Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
     That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
     whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
VIOLA
     He named Sebastian: I my brother know
     Yet living in my glass; even such and so
     In favour was my brother, and he went
     Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
     For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
     Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
     Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
     A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
     a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
     friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
     his cowardship, ask Fabian.
FABIAN
     A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
SIR ANDREW
     'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
SIR ANDREW
     An I do not,--
FABIAN
     Come, let's see the event.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.
     Exeunt
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house. ****
     Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown
Clown
     Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
SEBASTIAN
     Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
     Let me be clear of thee.
Clown
     Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
     I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
     speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
     nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
SEBASTIAN
     I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
     know'st not me.
Clown
     Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
     great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
     folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
     will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
     strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
     lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
SEBASTIAN
     I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
     money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
     worse payment.
Clown
     By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
     that give fools money get themselves a good
     report--after fourteen years' purchase.
     Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN
SIR ANDREW
     Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
SEBASTIAN
     Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
     the people mad?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
Clown
     This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
     in some of your coats for two pence.
     Exit
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come on, sir; hold.
SIR ANDREW
     Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
     with him; I'll have an action of battery against
     him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
     struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
SEBASTIAN
     Let go thy hand.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
     soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.
SEBASTIAN
     I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
     thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
     of this malapert blood from you.
     Enter OLIVIA
OLIVIA
     Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Madam!
OLIVIA
     Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
     Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
     Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
     Be not offended, dear Cesario.
     Rudesby, be gone!
     Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
     I prithee, gentle friend,
     Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
     In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
     Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
     And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
     This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
     Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
     Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
     He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
SEBASTIAN
     What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
     Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
     Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
     If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
OLIVIA
     Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!
SEBASTIAN
     Madam, I will.
OLIVIA
     O, say so, and so be!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. OLIVIA's house. ****
     Enter MARIA and Clown
MARIA
     Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
     make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
     it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.
     Exit
Clown
     Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
     in't; and I would I were the first that ever
     dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
     become the function well, nor lean enough to be
     thought a good student; but to be said an honest man
     and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
     careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Jove bless thee, master Parson.
Clown
     Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
     Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
     said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'
     so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,
     what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     To him, Sir Topas.
Clown
     What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.
MALVOLIO
     [Within] Who calls there?
Clown
     Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
     the lunatic.
MALVOLIO
     Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
Clown
     Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
     talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Well said, Master Parson.
MALVOLIO
     Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
     Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
     here in hideous darkness.
Clown
     Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
     modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones
     that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
     sayest thou that house is dark?
MALVOLIO
     As hell, Sir Topas.
Clown
     Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
     and the clearstores toward the south north are as
     lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
     obstruction?
MALVOLIO
     I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.
Clown
     Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
     but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than
     the Egyptians in their fog.
MALVOLIO
     I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
     ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there
     was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
     are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
Clown
     What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
MALVOLIO
     That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
Clown
     What thinkest thou of his opinion?
MALVOLIO
     I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
Clown
     Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
     thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
     allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
     thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
MALVOLIO
     Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
SIR TOBY BELCH
     My most exquisite Sir Topas!
Clown
     Nay, I am for all waters.
MARIA
     Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
     gown: he sees thee not.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
     thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
     knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
     would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
     my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
     sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
     Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
Clown
     [Singing]
     'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
     Tell me how thy lady does.'
MALVOLIO
     Fool!
Clown
     'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
MALVOLIO
     Fool!
Clown
     'Alas, why is she so?'
MALVOLIO
     Fool, I say!
Clown
     'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
MALVOLIO
     Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
     hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:
     as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
     thee for't.
Clown
     Master Malvolio?
MALVOLIO
     Ay, good fool.
Clown
     Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
MALVOLIO
     Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
     am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
Clown
     But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
     better in your wits than a fool.
MALVOLIO
     They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,
     send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
     face me out of my wits.
Clown
     Advise you what you say; the minister is here.
     Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
     endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
     bibble babble.
MALVOLIO
     Sir Topas!
Clown
     Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
     sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
     Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.
MALVOLIO
     Fool, fool, fool, I say!
Clown
     Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
     shent for speaking to you.
MALVOLIO
     Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
     tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
Clown
     Well-a-day that you were, sir
MALVOLIO
     By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
     light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
     it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
     of letter did.
Clown
     I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
     not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
MALVOLIO
     Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.
Clown
     Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
     brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
MALVOLIO
     Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
     prithee, be gone.
Clown
     [Singing]
     I am gone, sir,
     And anon, sir,
     I'll be with you again,
     In a trice,
     Like to the old Vice,
     Your need to sustain;
     Who, with dagger of lath,
     In his rage and his wrath,
     Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
     Like a mad lad,
     Pare thy nails, dad;
     Adieu, good man devil.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden. ****
     Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN
     This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
     This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
     And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
     Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
     I could not find him at the Elephant:
     Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
     That he did range the town to seek me out.
     His counsel now might do me golden service;
     For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
     That this may be some error, but no madness,
     Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
     So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
     That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
     And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
     To any other trust but that I am mad
     Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
     She could not sway her house, command her followers,
     Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
     With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
     As I perceive she does: there's something in't
     That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
     Enter OLIVIA and Priest
OLIVIA
     Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
     Now go with me and with this holy man
     Into the chantry by: there, before him,
     And underneath that consecrated roof,
     Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
     That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
     May live at peace. He shall conceal it
     Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
     What time we will our celebration keep
     According to my birth. What do you say?
SEBASTIAN
     I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
     And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
OLIVIA
     Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,
     That they may fairly note this act of mine!
     Exeunt

FABIAN
     Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
Clown
     Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
FABIAN
     Any thing.
Clown
     Do not desire to see this letter.
FABIAN
     This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
     dog again.
     Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords
DUKE ORSINO
     Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
Clown
     Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
DUKE ORSINO
     I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
Clown
     Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
     for my friends.
DUKE ORSINO
     Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
Clown
     No, sir, the worse.
DUKE ORSINO
     How can that be?
Clown
     Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
     now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
     my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
     and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
     conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
     make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
     my friends and the better for my foes.
DUKE ORSINO
     Why, this is excellent.
Clown
     By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
     one of my friends.
DUKE ORSINO
     Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
Clown
     But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
     you could make it another.
DUKE ORSINO
     O, you give me ill counsel.
Clown
     Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
     and let your flesh and blood obey it.
DUKE ORSINO
     Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
     double-dealer: there's another.
Clown
     Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
     saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
     sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
     Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
DUKE ORSINO
     You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
     if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
     with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
     my bounty further.
Clown
     Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
     again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
     that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
     but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
     will awake it anon.
     Exit
VIOLA
     Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
     Enter ANTONIO and Officers
DUKE ORSINO
     That face of his I do remember well;
     Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
     As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
     A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
     For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
     With which such scathful grapple did he make
     With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
     That very envy and the tongue of loss
     Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
First Officer
     Orsino, this is that Antonio
     That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
     And this is he that did the Tiger board,
     When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
     Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
     In private brabble did we apprehend him.
VIOLA
     He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
     But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
     I know not what 'twas but distraction.
DUKE ORSINO
     Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
     What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
     Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
     Hast made thine enemies?
ANTONIO
     Orsino, noble sir,
     Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
     Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
     Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
     Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
     That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
     From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
     Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
     His life I gave him and did thereto add
     My love, without retention or restraint,
     All his in dedication; for his sake
     Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
     Into the danger of this adverse town;
     Drew to defend him when he was beset:
     Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
     Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
     Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
     And grew a twenty years removed thing
     While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
     Which I had recommended to his use
     Not half an hour before.
VIOLA
     How can this be?
DUKE ORSINO
     When came he to this town?
ANTONIO
     To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
     No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
     Both day and night did we keep company.
     Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
DUKE ORSINO
     Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
     But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
     Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
     But more of that anon. Take him aside.
OLIVIA
     What would my lord, but that he may not have,
     Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
     Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
VIOLA
     Madam!
DUKE ORSINO
     Gracious Olivia,--
OLIVIA
     What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
VIOLA
     My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
OLIVIA
     If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
     It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
     As howling after music.
DUKE ORSINO
     Still so cruel?
OLIVIA
     Still so constant, lord.
DUKE ORSINO
     What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
     To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
     My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
     That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
OLIVIA
     Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
DUKE ORSINO
     Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
     Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
     Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
     That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
     Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
     And that I partly know the instrument
     That screws me from my true place in your favour,
     Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
     But this your minion, whom I know you love,
     And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
     Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
     Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
     Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
     I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
     To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
VIOLA
     And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
     To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
OLIVIA
     Where goes Cesario?
VIOLA
     After him I love
     More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
     More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
     If I do feign, you witnesses above
     Punish my life for tainting of my love!
OLIVIA
     Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
VIOLA
     Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
OLIVIA
     Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
     Call forth the holy father.
DUKE ORSINO
     Come, away!
OLIVIA
     Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
DUKE ORSINO
     Husband!
OLIVIA
     Ay, husband: can he that deny?
DUKE ORSINO
     Her husband, sirrah!
VIOLA
     No, my lord, not I.
OLIVIA
     Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
     That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
     Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
     Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
     As great as that thou fear'st.
     Enter Priest
     O, welcome, father!
     Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
     Here to unfold, though lately we intended
     To keep in darkness what occasion now
     Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
     Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
Priest
     A contract of eternal bond of love,
     Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
     Attested by the holy close of lips,
     Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
     And all the ceremony of this compact
     Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
     Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
     I have travell'd but two hours.
DUKE ORSINO
     O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
     When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
     Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
     That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
     Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
     Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
VIOLA
     My lord, I do protest--
OLIVIA
     O, do not swear!
     Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
     Enter SIR ANDREW
SIR ANDREW
     For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
     to Sir Toby.
OLIVIA
     What's the matter?
SIR ANDREW
     He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
     a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
     help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
OLIVIA
     Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
SIR ANDREW
     The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
     a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
DUKE ORSINO
     My gentleman, Cesario?
SIR ANDREW
     'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
     nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
     by Sir Toby.
VIOLA
     Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
     You drew your sword upon me without cause;
     But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
SIR ANDREW
     If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
     think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
     Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
     Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
     but if he had not been in drink, he would have
     tickled you othergates than he did.
DUKE ORSINO
     How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
SIR TOBY BELCH
     That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
     on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
Clown
     O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
     were set at eight i' the morning.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
     hate a drunken rogue.
OLIVIA
     Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
SIR ANDREW
     I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
SIR TOBY BELCH
     Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
     knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
OLIVIA
     Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
     Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
     Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN
     I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
     But, had it been the brother of my blood,
     I must have done no less with wit and safety.
     You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
     I do perceive it hath offended you:
     Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
     We made each other but so late ago.
DUKE ORSINO
     One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
     A natural perspective, that is and is not!
SEBASTIAN
     Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
     How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
     Since I have lost thee!
ANTONIO
     Sebastian are you?
SEBASTIAN
     Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
ANTONIO
     How have you made division of yourself?
     An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
     Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
OLIVIA
     Most wonderful!
SEBASTIAN
     Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
     Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
     Of here and every where. I had a sister,
     Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
     Of charity, what kin are you to me?
     What countryman? what name? what parentage?
VIOLA
     Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
     Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
     So went he suited to his watery tomb:
     If spirits can assume both form and suit
     You come to fright us.
SEBASTIAN
     A spirit I am indeed;
     But am in that dimension grossly clad
     Which from the womb I did participate.
     Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
     I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
     And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
VIOLA
     My father had a mole upon his brow.
SEBASTIAN
     And so had mine.
VIOLA
     And died that day when Viola from her birth
     Had number'd thirteen years.
SEBASTIAN
     O, that record is lively in my soul!
     He finished indeed his mortal act
     That day that made my sister thirteen years.
VIOLA
     If nothing lets to make us happy both
     But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
     Do not embrace me till each circumstance
     Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
     That I am Viola: which to confirm,
     I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
     Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
     I was preserved to serve this noble count.
     All the occurrence of my fortune since
     Hath been between this lady and this lord.
SEBASTIAN
     [To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
     But nature to her bias drew in that.
     You would have been contracted to a maid;
     Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
     You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
DUKE ORSINO
     Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
     If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
     I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
     To VIOLA
     Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
     Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
VIOLA
     And all those sayings will I overswear;
     And those swearings keep as true in soul
     As doth that orbed continent the fire
     That severs day from night.
DUKE ORSINO
     Give me thy hand;
     And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
VIOLA
     The captain that did bring me first on shore
     Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
     Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
     A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
OLIVIA
     He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
     And yet, alas, now I remember me,
     They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
     Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
     A most extracting frenzy of mine own
     From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
     How does he, sirrah?
Clown
     Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
     well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
     letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
     morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
     so it skills not much when they are delivered.
OLIVIA
     Open't, and read it.
Clown
     Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
     the madman.
     Reads
     'By the Lord, madam,'--
OLIVIA
     How now! art thou mad?
Clown
     No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
     will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
OLIVIA
     Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
Clown
     So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
     read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
OLIVIA
     Read it you, sirrah.
     To FABIAN
FABIAN
     [Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
     world shall know it: though you have put me into
     darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
     me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
     your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
     me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
     not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
     Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
     unthought of and speak out of my injury.
     THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
OLIVIA
     Did he write this?
Clown
     Ay, madam.
DUKE ORSINO
     This savours not much of distraction.
OLIVIA
     See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
     Exit FABIAN
     My lord so please you, these things further
     thought on,
     To think me as well a sister as a wife,
     One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
     Here at my house and at my proper cost.
DUKE ORSINO
     Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
     To VIOLA
     Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
     So much against the mettle of your sex,
     So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
     And since you call'd me master for so long,
     Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
     Your master's mistress.
OLIVIA
     A sister! you are she.
     Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO
DUKE ORSINO
     Is this the madman?
OLIVIA
     Ay, my lord, this same.
     How now, Malvolio!
MALVOLIO
     Madam, you have done me wrong,
     Notorious wrong.
OLIVIA
     Have I, Malvolio? no.
MALVOLIO
     Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
     You must not now deny it is your hand:
     Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
     Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
     You can say none of this: well, grant it then
     And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
     Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
     Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
     To put on yellow stockings and to frown
     Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
     And, acting this in an obedient hope,
     Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
     Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
     And made the most notorious geck and gull
     That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
OLIVIA
     Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
     Though, I confess, much like the character
     But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
     And now I do bethink me, it was she
     First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
     And in such forms which here were presupposed
     Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
     This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
     But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
     Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
     Of thine own cause.
FABIAN
     Good madam, hear me speak,
     And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
     Taint the condition of this present hour,
     Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
     Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
     Set this device against Malvolio here,
     Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
     We had conceived against him: Maria writ
     The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
     In recompense whereof he hath married her.
     How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
     May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
     If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
     That have on both sides pass'd.
OLIVIA
     Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
Clown
     Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
     and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
     one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
     that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
     But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
     a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
     and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
MALVOLIO
     I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
     Exit
OLIVIA
     He hath been most notoriously abused.
DUKE ORSINO
     Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
     He hath not told us of the captain yet:
     When that is known and golden time convents,
     A solemn combination shall be made
     Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
     We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
     For so you shall be, while you are a man;
     But when in other habits you are seen,
     Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
     Exeunt all, except Clown
Clown
     [Sings]
     When that I was and a little tiny boy,
     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
     A foolish thing was but a toy,
     For the rain it raineth every day.
     But when I came to man's estate,
     With hey, ho, & c.
     'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
     For the rain, & c.
     But when I came, alas! to wive,
     With hey, ho, & c.
     By swaggering could I never thrive,
     For the rain, & c.
     But when I came unto my beds,
     With hey, ho, & c.
     With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
     For the rain, & c.
     A great while ago the world begun,
     With hey, ho, & c.
     But that's all one, our play is done,
     And we'll strive to please you every day.

**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. London. The palace. ****
     Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,
     SALISBURY, WARWICK, and CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET,
     SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other
SUFFOLK
     As by your high imperial majesty
     I had in charge at my depart for France,
     As procurator to your excellence,
     To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,
     So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
     In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
     The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,
     Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,
     I have perform'd my task and was espoused:
     And humbly now upon my bended knee,
     In sight of England and her lordly peers,
     Deliver up my title in the queen
     To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
     Of that great shadow I did represent;
     The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
     The fairest queen that ever king received.
KING HENRY VI
     Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
     I can express no kinder sign of love
     Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,
     Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
     For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
     A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
     If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Great King of England and my gracious lord,
     The mutual conference that my mind hath had,
     By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
     In courtly company or at my beads,
     With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,
     Makes me the bolder to salute my king
     With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
     And over-joy of heart doth minister.
KING HENRY VI
     Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
     Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
     Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;
     Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
     Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
ALL
     [Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret, England's
     happiness!
QUEEN MARGARET
     We thank you all.
     Flourish
SUFFOLK
     My lord protector, so it please your grace,
     Here are the articles of contracted peace
     Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,
     For eighteen months concluded by consent.
GLOUCESTER
     [Reads] 'Imprimis, it is agreed between the French
     king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of
     Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that
     the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,
     daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and
     Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the
     thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchy
     of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
     and delivered to the king her father'--
     Lets the paper fall
KING HENRY VI
     Uncle, how now!
GLOUCESTER
     Pardon me, gracious lord;
     Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
     And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
KING HENRY VI
     Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
CARDINAL
     [Reads] 'Item, It is further agreed between them,
     that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be
     released and delivered over to the king her father,
     and she sent over of the King of England's own
     proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'
KING HENRY VI
     They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:
     We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,
     And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
     We here discharge your grace from being regent
     I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
     Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
     Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
     Salisbury, and Warwick;
     We thank you all for the great favour done,
     In entertainment to my princely queen.
     Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
     To see her coronation be perform'd.
     Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK
GLOUCESTER
     Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
     To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
     Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
     What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
     His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
     Did he so often lodge in open field,
     In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
     To conquer France, his true inheritance?
     And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
     To keep by policy what Henry got?
     Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
     Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
     Received deep scars in France and Normandy?
     Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
     With all the learned council of the realm,
     Studied so long, sat in the council-house
     Early and late, debating to and fro
     How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
     And had his highness in his infancy
     Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
     And shall these labours and these honours die?
     Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
     Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
     O peers of England, shameful is this league!
     Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
     Blotting your names from books of memory,
     Razing the characters of your renown,
     Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
     Undoing all, as all had never been!
CARDINAL
     Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
     This peroration with such circumstance?
     For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;
     But now it is impossible we should:
     Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
     Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
     Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
     Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
SALISBURY
     Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
     These counties were the keys of Normandy.
     But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
WARWICK
     For grief that they are past recovery:
     For, were there hope to conquer them again,
     My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
     Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
     Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
     And are the cities, that I got with wounds,
     Delivered up again with peaceful words?
     Mort Dieu!
YORK
     For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
     That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
     France should have torn and rent my very heart,
     Before I would have yielded to this league.
     I never read but England's kings have had
     Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
     And our King Henry gives away his own,
     To match with her that brings no vantages.
GLOUCESTER
     A proper jest, and never heard before,
     That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
     For costs and charges in transporting her!
     She should have stayed in France and starved
     in France, Before--
CARDINAL
     My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:
     It was the pleasure of my lord the King.
GLOUCESTER
     My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
     'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
     But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
     Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
     I see thy fury: if I longer stay,
     We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
     Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
     I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
     Exit
CARDINAL
     So, there goes our protector in a rage.
     'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
     Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
     And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
     Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
     And heir apparent to the English crown:
     Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
     And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
     There's reason he should be displeased at it.
     Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
     Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
     What though the common people favour him,
     Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of
     Gloucester,'
     Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
     'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
     With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
     I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
     He will be found a dangerous protector.
BUCKINGHAM
     Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,
     He being of age to govern of himself?
     Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
     And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
     We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
CARDINAL
     This weighty business will not brook delay:
     I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
     Exit
SOMERSET
     Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
     And greatness of his place be grief to us,
     Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
     His insolence is more intolerable
     Than all the princes in the land beside:
     If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.
BUCKINGHAM
     Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,
     Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
     Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
SALISBURY
     Pride went before, ambition follows him.
     While these do labour for their own preferment,
     Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
     I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
     Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
     Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,
     More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
     As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
     Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
     Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
     Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
     Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,
     Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
     Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
     And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
     In bringing them to civil discipline,
     Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
     When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
     Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:
     Join we together, for the public good,
     In what we can, to bridle and suppress
     The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
     With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
     And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
     While they do tend the profit of the land.
WARWICK
     So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
     And common profit of his country!
YORK
     [Aside] And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
SALISBURY
     Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
WARWICK
     Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
     That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
     And would have kept so long as breath did last!
     Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
     Which I will win from France, or else be slain,
     Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY
YORK
     Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
     Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
     Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
     Suffolk concluded on the articles,
     The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
     To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
     I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
     'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
     Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
     And purchase friends and give to courtezans,
     Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
     While as the silly owner of the goods
     Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
     And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
     While all is shared and all is borne away,
     Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
     So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
     While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
     Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland
     Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
     As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
     Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
     Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
     Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
     Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
     A day will come when York shall claim his own;
     And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
     And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
     And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
     For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:
     Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
     Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
     Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
     Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
     Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
     Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
     To pry into the secrets of the state;
     Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
     With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
     And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
     Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
     With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;
     And in my standard bear the arms of York
     To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
     And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
     Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.

     Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS
DUCHESS
     Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,
     Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
     Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
     As frowning at the favours of the world?
     Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
     Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
     What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
     Enchased with all the honours of the world?
     If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
     Until thy head be circled with the same.
     Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
     What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:
     And, having both together heaved it up,
     We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
     And never more abase our sight so low
     As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
GLOUCESTER
     O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
     Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.
     And may that thought, when I imagine ill
     Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
     Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
     My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
DUCHESS
     What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it
     With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
GLOUCESTER
     Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
     Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
     But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;
     And on the pieces of the broken wand
     Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
     And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.
     This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.
DUCHESS
     Tut, this was nothing but an argument
     That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
     Shall lose his head for his presumption.
     But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
     Methought I sat in seat of majesty
     In the cathedral church of Westminster,
     And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;
     Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
     And on my head did set the diadem.
GLOUCESTER
     Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:
     Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,
     Art thou not second woman in the realm,
     And the protector's wife, beloved of him?
     Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
     Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
     And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
     To tumble down thy husband and thyself
     From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
     Away from me, and let me hear no more!
DUCHESS
     What, what, my lord! are you so choleric
     With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
     Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,
     And not be cheque'd.
GLOUCESTER
     Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
     Enter Messenger
Messenger
     My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure
     You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,
     Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
GLOUCESTER
     I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
DUCHESS
     Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
     Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger
     Follow I must; I cannot go before,
     While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
     Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
     I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
     And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
     And, being a woman, I will not be slack
     To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
     Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,
     We are alone; here's none but thee and I.
     Enter HUME
HUME
     Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
DUCHESS
     What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
HUME
     But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,
     Your grace's title shall be multiplied.
DUCHESS
     What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd
     With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
     With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?
     And will they undertake to do me good?
HUME
     This they have promised, to show your highness
     A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,
     That shall make answer to such questions
     As by your grace shall be propounded him.
DUCHESS
     It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:
     When from St. Alban's we do make return,
     We'll see these things effected to the full.
     Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,
     With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
     Exit
HUME
     Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
     Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
     Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
     The business asketh silent secrecy.
     Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
     Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
     Yet have I gold flies from another coast;
     I dare not say, from the rich cardinal
     And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,
     Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,
     They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
     Have hired me to undermine the duchess
     And buz these conjurations in her brain.
     They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'
     Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
     Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
     To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
     Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
     Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,
     And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:
     Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.

**** SCENE III. The palace. ****
     Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one
First Petitioner
     My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector
     will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver
     our supplications in the quill.
Second Petitioner
     Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!
     Jesu bless him!
     Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET
PETER
     Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.
     I'll be the first, sure.
Second Petitioner
     Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk, and
     not my lord protector.
SUFFOLK
     How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?
First Petitioner
     I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lord
     protector.
QUEEN MARGARET
     [Reading] 'To my Lord Protector!' Are your
     supplications to his lordship? Let me see them:
     what is thine?
First Petitioner
     Mine is, an't please your grace, against John
     Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my
     house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.
SUFFOLK
     Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's
     yours? What's here!
     Reads
     'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the
     commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!
Second Petitioner
     Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.
PETER
     [Giving his petition] Against my master, Thomas
     Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful
     heir to the crown.
QUEEN MARGARET
     What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was
     rightful heir to the crown?
PETER
     That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said
     that he was, and that the king was an usurper.
SUFFOLK
     Who is there?
     Enter Servant
     Take this fellow in, and send for
     his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear
     more of your matter before the King.
     Exit Servant with PETER
QUEEN MARGARET
     And as for you, that love to be protected
     Under the wings of our protector's grace,
     Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
     Tears the supplication
     Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.
ALL
     Come, let's be gone.
     Exeunt
QUEEN MARGARET
     My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
     Is this the fashion in the court of England?
     Is this the government of Britain's isle,
     And this the royalty of Albion's king?
     What shall King Henry be a pupil still
     Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
     Am I a queen in title and in style,
     And must be made a subject to a duke?
     I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
     Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
     And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,
     I thought King Henry had resembled thee
     In courage, courtship and proportion:
     But all his mind is bent to holiness,
     To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
     His champions are the prophets and apostles,
     His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
     His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
     Are brazen images of canonized saints.
     I would the college of the cardinals
     Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,
     And set the triple crown upon his head:
     That were a state fit for his holiness.
SUFFOLK
     Madam, be patient: as I was cause
     Your highness came to England, so will I
     In England work your grace's full content.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,
     The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
     And grumbling York: and not the least of these
     But can do more in England than the king.
SUFFOLK
     And he of these that can do most of all
     Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
     Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Not all these lords do vex me half so much
     As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.
     She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
     More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:
     Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
     She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
     And in her heart she scorns our poverty:
     Shall I not live to be avenged on her?
     Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,
     She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,
     The very train of her worst wearing gown
     Was better worth than all my father's lands,
     Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
SUFFOLK
     Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,
     And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
     That she will light to listen to the lays,
     And never mount to trouble you again.
     So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;
     For I am bold to counsel you in this.
     Although we fancy not the cardinal,
     Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
     Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
     As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
     Will make but little for his benefit.
     So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
     And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
     Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL,
     BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESS
KING HENRY VI
     For my part, noble lords, I care not which;
     Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.
YORK
     If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
     Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
SOMERSET
     If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
     Let York be regent; I will yield to him.
WARWICK
     Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,
     Dispute not that: York is the worthier.
CARDINAL
     Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
WARWICK
     The cardinal's not my better in the field.
BUCKINGHAM
     All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
WARWICK
     Warwick may live to be the best of all.
SALISBURY
     Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,
     Why Somerset should be preferred in this.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.
GLOUCESTER
     Madam, the king is old enough himself
     To give his censure: these are no women's matters.
QUEEN MARGARET
     If he be old enough, what needs your grace
     To be protector of his excellence?
GLOUCESTER
     Madam, I am protector of the realm;
     And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.
SUFFOLK
     Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
     Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
     The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;
     The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
     And all the peers and nobles of the realm
     Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
CARDINAL
     The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
     Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
SOMERSET
     Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
     Have cost a mass of public treasury.
BUCKINGHAM
     Thy cruelty in execution
     Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
     And left thee to the mercy of the law.
QUEEN MARGARET
     They sale of offices and towns in France,
     If they were known, as the suspect is great,
     Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
     Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan
     Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?
     She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear
     I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?
DUCHESS
     Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:
     Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
     I'd set my ten commandments in your face.
KING HENRY VI
     Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
DUCHESS
     Against her will! good king, look to't in time;
     She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:
     Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
     She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.
     Exit
BUCKINGHAM
     Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
     And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:
     She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
     She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.
     Exit
     Re-enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     Now, lords, my choler being over-blown
     With walking once about the quadrangle,
     I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
     As for your spiteful false objections,
     Prove them, and I lie open to the law:
     But God in mercy so deal with my soul,
     As I in duty love my king and country!
     But, to the matter that we have in hand:
     I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
     To be your regent in the realm of France.
SUFFOLK
     Before we make election, give me leave
     To show some reason, of no little force,
     That York is most unmeet of any man.
YORK
     I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
     First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
     Next, if I be appointed for the place,
     My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
     Without discharge, money, or furniture,
     Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:
     Last time, I danced attendance on his will
     Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.
WARWICK
     That can I witness; and a fouler fact
     Did never traitor in the land commit.
SUFFOLK
     Peace, headstrong Warwick!
WARWICK
     Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
     Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded
SUFFOLK
     Because here is a man accused of treason:
     Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
YORK
     Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
KING HENRY VI
     What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?
SUFFOLK
     Please it your majesty, this is the man
     That doth accuse his master of high treason:
     His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
     Was rightful heir unto the English crown
     And that your majesty was a usurper.
KING HENRY VI
     Say, man, were these thy words?
HORNER
     An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor
     thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am
     falsely accused by the villain.
PETER
     By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to
     me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
     Lord of York's armour.
YORK
     Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
     I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
     I do beseech your royal majesty,
     Let him have all the rigor of the law.
HORNER
     Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.
     My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct
     him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his
     knees he would be even with me: I have good
     witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,
     do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
     accusation.
KING HENRY VI
     Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
GLOUCESTER
     This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
     Let Somerset be regent over the French,
     Because in York this breeds suspicion:
     And let these have a day appointed them
     For single combat in convenient place,
     For he hath witness of his servant's malice:
     This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
SOMERSET
     I humbly thank your royal majesty.
HORNER
     And I accept the combat willingly.
PETER
     Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity
     my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O
     Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to
     fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!
GLOUCESTER
     Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.
KING HENRY VI
     Away with them to prison; and the day of combat
     shall be the last of the next month. Come,
     Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.
     Flourish. Exeunt

HUME
     Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.
BOLINGBROKE
     I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
     invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,
     Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be
     busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,
     and leave us.
     Exit HUME
     Mother Jourdain, be you
     prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,
     read you; and let us to our work.
     Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following
DUCHESS
     Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this
     gear the sooner the better.
BOLINGBROKE
     Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
     Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
     The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
     The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
     And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,
     That time best fits the work we have in hand.
     Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,
     We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
     Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the circle;
     BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te, & c. It thunders and
     lightens terribly; then the Spirit riseth
Spirit
     Adsum.
MARGARET JOURDAIN
     Asmath,
     By the eternal God, whose name and power
     Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
     For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.
Spirit
     Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!
BOLINGBROKE
     'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
     Reading out of a paper
Spirit
     The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
     But him outlive, and die a violent death.
     As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer
BOLINGBROKE
     'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
Spirit
     By water shall he die, and take his end.
BOLINGBROKE
     'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
Spirit
     Let him shun castles;
     Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
     Than where castles mounted stand.
     Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
BOLINGBROKE
     Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
     False fiend, avoid!
     Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit
     Enter YORK and BUCKINGHAM with their Guard and break in
YORK
     Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
     Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
     What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal
     Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:
     My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
     See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
DUCHESS
     Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
     Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.
BUCKINGHAM
     True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
     Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.
     And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
     Stafford, take her to thee.
     Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded
     We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
     All, away!
     Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, & c
YORK
     Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
     A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
     Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
     What have we here?
     Reads
     'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;
     But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
     Why, this is just
     'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'
     Well, to the rest:
     'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
     By water shall he die, and take his end.
     What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
     Let him shun castles;
     Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
     Than where castles mounted stand.'
     Come, come, my lords;
     These oracles are hardly attain'd,
     And hardly understood.
     The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,
     With him the husband of this lovely lady:
     Thither go these news, as fast as horse can
     carry them:
     A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.
BUCKINGHAM
     Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
     To be the post, in hope of his reward.
YORK
     At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within
     there, ho!
     Enter a Servingman
     Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
     To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. Saint Alban's. ****
     Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, and
     SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing
QUEEN MARGARET
     Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
     I saw not better sport these seven years' day:
     Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;
     And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.
KING HENRY VI
     But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
     And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
     To see how God in all his creatures works!
     Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
SUFFOLK
     No marvel, an it like your majesty,
     My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;
     They know their master loves to be aloft,
     And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
GLOUCESTER
     My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
     That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
CARDINAL
     I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?
     Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?
KING HENRY VI
     The treasury of everlasting joy.
CARDINAL
     Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
     Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;
     Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,
     That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!
GLOUCESTER
     What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
     Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?
     Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice;
     With such holiness can you do it?
SUFFOLK
     No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
     So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
GLOUCESTER
     As who, my lord?
SUFFOLK
     Why, as you, my lord,
     An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
QUEEN MARGARET
     And thy ambition, Gloucester.
KING HENRY VI
     I prithee, peace, good queen,
     And whet not on these furious peers;
     For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
CARDINAL
     Let me be blessed for the peace I make,
     Against this proud protector, with my sword!
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would
     'twere come to that!
CARDINAL
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Marry, when thou darest.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CARDINAL] Make up no factious
     numbers for the matter;
     In thine own person answer thy abuse.
CARDINAL
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Ay, where thou darest
     not peep: an if thou darest,
     This evening, on the east side of the grove.
KING HENRY VI
     How now, my lords!
CARDINAL
     Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
     Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
     We had had more sport.
     Aside to GLOUCESTER
     Come with thy two-hand sword.
GLOUCESTER
     True, uncle.
CARDINAL
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advised? the
     east side of the grove?
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
GLOUCESTER
     Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
     Aside to CARDINAL
     Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,
     Or all my fence shall fail.
CARDINAL
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] Medice, teipsum--
     Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.
KING HENRY VI
     The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
     How irksome is this music to my heart!
     When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
     I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
     Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!'
GLOUCESTER
     What means this noise?
     Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
Townsman
     A miracle! a miracle!
SUFFOLK
     Come to the king and tell him what miracle.
Townsman
     Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
     Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;
     A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
KING HENRY VI
     Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
     Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
     Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his brethren, bearing SIMPCOX,
     between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following
CARDINAL
     Here comes the townsmen on procession,
     To present your highness with the man.
KING HENRY VI
     Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
     Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
GLOUCESTER
     Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
     His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
KING HENRY VI
     Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
     That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
     What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?
SIMPCOX
     Born blind, an't please your grace.
Wife
     Ay, indeed, was he.
SUFFOLK
     What woman is this?
Wife
     His wife, an't like your worship.
GLOUCESTER
     Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have
     better told.
KING HENRY VI
     Where wert thou born?
SIMPCOX
     At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.
KING HENRY VI
     Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:
     Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
     But still remember what the Lord hath done.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,
     Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
SIMPCOX
     God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
     A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,
     By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,
     Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
Wife
     Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
     Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
CARDINAL
     What, art thou lame?
SIMPCOX
     Ay, God Almighty help me!
SUFFOLK
     How camest thou so?
SIMPCOX
     A fall off of a tree.
Wife
     A plum-tree, master.
GLOUCESTER
     How long hast thou been blind?
SIMPCOX
     Born so, master.
GLOUCESTER
     What, and wouldst climb a tree?
SIMPCOX
     But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
Wife
     Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
GLOUCESTER
     Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst
     venture so.
SIMPCOX
     Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,
     And made me climb, with danger of my life.
GLOUCESTER
     A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
     Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:
     In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
SIMPCOX
     Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and
     Saint Alban.
GLOUCESTER
     Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
SIMPCOX
     Red, master; red as blood.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
SIMPCOX
     Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
SUFFOLK
     And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
GLOUCESTER
     But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.
Wife
     Never, before this day, in all his life.
GLOUCESTER
     Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
SIMPCOX
     Alas, master, I know not.
GLOUCESTER
     What's his name?
SIMPCOX
     I know not.
GLOUCESTER
     Nor his?
SIMPCOX
     No, indeed, master.
GLOUCESTER
     What's thine own name?
SIMPCOX
     Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
GLOUCESTER
     Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in
     Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
     mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
     name the several colours we do wear. Sight may
     distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them
     all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here
     hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his
     cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple
     to his legs again?
SIMPCOX
     O master, that you could!
GLOUCESTER
     My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in
     your town, and things called whips?
Mayor
     Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.
GLOUCESTER
     Then send for one presently.
Mayor
     Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
     Exit an Attendant
GLOUCESTER
     Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,
     if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me
     over this stool and run away.
SIMPCOX
     Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:
     You go about to torture me in vain.
     Enter a Beadle with whips
GLOUCESTER
     Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah
     beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.
Beadle
     I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your
     doublet quickly.
SIMPCOX
     Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
     After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs
     away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'
KING HENRY VI
     O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
QUEEN MARGARET
     It made me laugh to see the villain run.
GLOUCESTER
     Follow the knave; and take this drab away.
Wife
     Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.
GLOUCESTER
     Let them be whipped through every market-town, till
     they come to Berwick, from whence they came.
     Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, & c
CARDINAL
     Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
SUFFOLK
     True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
GLOUCESTER
     But you have done more miracles than I;
     You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.
     Enter BUCKINGHAM
KING HENRY VI
     What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM
     Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
     A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
     Under the countenance and confederacy
     Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
     The ringleader and head of all this rout,
     Have practised dangerously against your state,
     Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
     Whom we have apprehended in the fact;
     Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,
     Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
     And other of your highness' privy-council;
     As more at large your grace shall understand.
CARDINAL
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] And so, my lord protector,
     by this means
     Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
     This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;
     'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
GLOUCESTER
     Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:
     Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;
     And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,
     Or to the meanest groom.
KING HENRY VI
     O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
     Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.
     And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
GLOUCESTER
     Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,
     How I have loved my king and commonweal:
     And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;
     Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
     Noble she is, but if she have forgot
     Honour and virtue and conversed with such
     As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
     I banish her my bed and company
     And give her as a prey to law and shame,
     That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.
KING HENRY VI
     Well, for this night we will repose us here:
     To-morrow toward London back again,
     To look into this business thoroughly
     And call these foul offenders to their answers
     And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
     Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.
     Flourish. Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden. ****
     Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK
YORK
     Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
     Our simple supper ended, give me leave
     In this close walk to satisfy myself,
     In craving your opinion of my title,
     Which is infallible, to England's crown.
SALISBURY
     My lord, I long to hear it at full.
WARWICK
     Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
     The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
YORK
     Then thus:
     Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
     The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
     The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,
     Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
     Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
     The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
     The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
     William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
     Edward the Black Prince died before his father
     And left behind him Richard, his only son,
     Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;
     Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
     The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
     Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
     Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
     Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
     And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
     Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
WARWICK
     Father, the duke hath told the truth:
     Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
YORK
     Which now they hold by force and not by right;
     For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
     The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
SALISBURY
     But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
YORK
     The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
     I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,
     Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
     Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
     Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.
SALISBURY
     This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
     As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
     And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
     Who kept him in captivity till he died.
     But to the rest.
YORK
     His eldest sister, Anne,
     My mother, being heir unto the crown
     Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son
     To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
     By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
     To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
     Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
     Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:
     So, if the issue of the elder son
     Succeed before the younger, I am king.
WARWICK
     What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
     Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
     The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
     Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:
     It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
     And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
     Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;
     And in this private plot be we the first
     That shall salute our rightful sovereign
     With honour of his birthright to the crown.
BOTH
     Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
YORK
     We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
     Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
     With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
     And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
     But with advice and silent secrecy.
     Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
     Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
     At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
     At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
     Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
     That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
     'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that
     Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
SALISBURY
     My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
WARWICK
     My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
     Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
YORK
     And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:
     Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
     The greatest man in England but the king.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. A hall of justice. ****
     Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER,
     YORK, SUFFOLK, and SALISBURY; the DUCHESS, MARGARET JOURDAIN,
     SOUTHWELL, HUME, and BOLINGBROKE, under guard
KING HENRY VI
     Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:
     In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:
     Receive the sentence of the law for sins
     Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.
     You four, from hence to prison back again;
     From thence unto the place of execution:
     The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,
     And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
     You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
     Despoiled of your honour in your life,
     Shall, after three days' open penance done,
     Live in your country here in banishment,
     With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.
DUCHESS
     Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
GLOUCESTER
     Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:
     I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
     Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded
     Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
     Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age
     Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
     I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;
     Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
KING HENRY VI
     Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,
     Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself
     Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
     My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:
     And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
     Than when thou wert protector to thy King.
QUEEN MARGARET
     I see no reason why a king of years
     Should be to be protected like a child.
     God and King Henry govern England's realm.
     Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.
GLOUCESTER
     My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:
     As willingly do I the same resign
     As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;
     And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
     As others would ambitiously receive it.
     Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,
     May honourable peace attend thy throne!
     Exit
QUEEN MARGARET
     Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;
     And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
     That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;
     His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.
     This staff of honour raught, there let it stand
     Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.
SUFFOLK
     Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
     Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.
YORK
     Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,
     This is the day appointed for the combat;
     And ready are the appellant and defendant,
     The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,
     So please your highness to behold the fight.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore
     Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
KING HENRY VI
     O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:
     Here let them end it; and God defend the right!
YORK
     I never saw a fellow worse bested,
     Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,
     The servant of this armourer, my lords.
     Enter at one door, HORNER, the Armourer, and his Neighbours, drinking
     to him so much that he is drunk; and he enters with a drum before him
     and his staff with a sand-bag fastened to it; and at the other door
     PETER, his man, with a drum and sand-bag, and 'Prentices drinking to
     him
First Neighbour
     Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of
     sack: and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.
Second Neighbour
     And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.
Third Neighbour
     And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour:
     drink, and fear not your man.
HORNER
     Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and
     a fig for Peter!
     First 'Prentice Here, Peter, I drink to thee: and be not afraid.
     Second 'Prentice Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight
     for credit of the 'prentices.
PETER
     I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray
     you; for I think I have taken my last draught in
     this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee
     my apron: and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer:
     and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O
     Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to
     deal with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.
SALISBURY
     Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.
     Sirrah, what's thy name?
PETER
     Peter, forsooth.
SALISBURY
     Peter! what more?
PETER
     Thump.
SALISBURY
     Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.
HORNER
     Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
     instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an
     honest man: and touching the Duke of York, I will
     take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the
     king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at
     thee with a downright blow!
YORK
     Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.
     Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!
     Alarum. They fight, and PETER strikes him down
HORNER
     Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
     Dies
YORK
     Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the
     good wine in thy master's way.
PETER
     O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?
     O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!
KING HENRY VI
     Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;
     For his death we do perceive his guilt:
     And God in justice hath revealed to us
     The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
     Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
     Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
     Sound a flourish. Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. A street. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen, in mourning cloaks
GLOUCESTER
     Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
     And after summer evermore succeeds
     Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold:
     So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
     Sirs, what's o'clock?
Servants
     Ten, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
     Ten is the hour that was appointed me
     To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:
     Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
     To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
     Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
     The abject people gazing on thy face,
     With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
     That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
     When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
     But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare
     My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.
     Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper burning in her hand;
     with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and Officers
Servant
     So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.
GLOUCESTER
     No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.
DUCHESS
     Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
     Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
     See how the giddy multitude do point,
     And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!
     Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
     And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,
     And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
GLOUCESTER
     Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
DUCHESS
     Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
     For whilst I think I am thy married wife
     And thou a prince, protector of this land,
     Methinks I should not thus be led along,
     Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,
     And followed with a rabble that rejoice
     To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
     The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
     And when I start, the envious people laugh
     And bid me be advised how I tread.
     Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
     Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,
     Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
     No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
     To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
     Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,
     And he a prince and ruler of the land:
     Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
     As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
     Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
     To every idle rascal follower.
     But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,
     Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
     Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
     For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
     With her that hateth thee and hates us all,
     And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
     Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
     And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:
     But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
     Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
GLOUCESTER
     Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;
     I must offend before I be attainted;
     And had I twenty times so many foes,
     And each of them had twenty times their power,
     All these could not procure me any scathe,
     So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.
     Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
     Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away
     But I in danger for the breach of law.
     Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:
     I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;
     These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
     Enter a Herald
Herald
     I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,
     Holden at Bury the first of this next month.
GLOUCESTER
     And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
     This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.
     Exit Herald
     My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,
     Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.
Sheriff
     An't please your grace, here my commission stays,
     And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
     To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
GLOUCESTER
     Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
STANLEY
     So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.
GLOUCESTER
     Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
     You use her well: the world may laugh again;
     And I may live to do you kindness if
     You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!
DUCHESS
     What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
GLOUCESTER
     Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
     Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen
DUCHESS
     Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!
     For none abides with me: my joy is death;
     Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,
     Because I wish'd this world's eternity.
     Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;
     I care not whither, for I beg no favour,
     Only convey me where thou art commanded.
STANLEY
     Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;
     There to be used according to your state.
DUCHESS
     That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
     And shall I then be used reproachfully?
STANLEY
     Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;
     According to that state you shall be used.
DUCHESS
     Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
     Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.
Sheriff
     It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.
DUCHESS
     Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.
     Come, Stanley, shall we go?
STANLEY
     Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
     And go we to attire you for our journey.
DUCHESS
     My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:
     No, it will hang upon my richest robes
     And show itself, attire me how I can.
     Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's. ****
     Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL,
     SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament
KING HENRY VI
     I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
     'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
     Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Can you not see? or will ye not observe
     The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
     With what a majesty he bears himself,
     How insolent of late he is become,
     How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
     We know the time since he was mild and affable,
     And if we did but glance a far-off look,
     Immediately he was upon his knee,
     That all the court admired him for submission:
     But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
     When every one will give the time of day,
     He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
     And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
     Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
     Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
     But great men tremble when the lion roars;
     And Humphrey is no little man in England.
     First note that he is near you in descent,
     And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
     Me seemeth then it is no policy,
     Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
     And his advantage following your decease,
     That he should come about your royal person
     Or be admitted to your highness' council.
     By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
     And when he please to make commotion,
     'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
     Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
     Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden
     And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
     The reverent care I bear unto my lord
     Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
     If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;
     Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
     I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
     My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
     Reprove my allegation, if you can;
     Or else conclude my words effectual.
SUFFOLK
     Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
     And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
     I think I should have told your grace's tale.
     The duchess, by his subornation,
     Upon my life, began her devilish practises:
     Or, if he were not privy to those faults,
     Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
     As next the king he was successive heir,
     And such high vaunts of his nobility,
     Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
     By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
     Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
     And in his simple show he harbours treason.
     The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
     No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
     Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
CARDINAL
     Did he not, contrary to form of law,
     Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
YORK
     And did he not, in his protectorship,
     Levy great sums of money through the realm
     For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
     By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
BUCKINGHAM
     Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.
     Which time will bring to light in smooth
     Duke Humphrey.
KING HENRY VI
     My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
     To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
     Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,
     Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
     From meaning treason to our royal person
     As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
     The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
     To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
     Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,
     For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
     Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,
     For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
     Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
     Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all
     Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
     Enter SOMERSET
SOMERSET
     All health unto my gracious sovereign!
KING HENRY VI
     Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
SOMERSET
     That all your interest in those territories
     Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.
KING HENRY VI
     Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!
YORK
     [Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France
     As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
     Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
     And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
     But I will remedy this gear ere long,
     Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
     Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     All happiness unto my lord the king!
     Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
SUFFOLK
     Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
     Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
     I do arrest thee of high treason here.
GLOUCESTER
     Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
     Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
     A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
     The purest spring is not so free from mud
     As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:
     Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?
YORK
     'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,
     And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;
     By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
GLOUCESTER
     Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?
     I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,
     Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
     So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,
     Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,
     That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,
     Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
     Be brought against me at my trial-day!
     No; many a pound of mine own proper store,
     Because I would not tax the needy commons,
     Have I disbursed to the garrisons,
     And never ask'd for restitution.
CARDINAL
     It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
GLOUCESTER
     I say no more than truth, so help me God!
YORK
     In your protectorship you did devise
     Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,
     That England was defamed by tyranny.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was
     protector,
     Pity was all the fault that was in me;
     For I should melt at an offender's tears,
     And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
     Unless it were a bloody murderer,
     Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
     I never gave them condign punishment:
     Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured
     Above the felon or what trespass else.
SUFFOLK
     My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:
     But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
     Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
     I do arrest you in his highness' name;
     And here commit you to my lord cardinal
     To keep, until your further time of trial.
KING HENRY VI
     My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
     That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
     My conscience tells me you are innocent.
GLOUCESTER
     Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:
     Virtue is choked with foul ambition
     And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;
     Foul subornation is predominant
     And equity exiled your highness' land.
     I know their complot is to have my life,
     And if my death might make this island happy,
     And prove the period of their tyranny,
     I would expend it with all willingness:
     But mine is made the prologue to their play;
     For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
     Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
     Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
     And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
     Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
     The envious load that lies upon his heart;
     And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
     Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
     By false accuse doth level at my life:
     And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
     Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
     And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
     My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
     Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
     Myself had notice of your conventicles--
     And all to make away my guiltless life.
     I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
     Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
     The ancient proverb will be well effected:
     'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
CARDINAL
     My liege, his railing is intolerable:
     If those that care to keep your royal person
     From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
     Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,
     And the offender granted scope of speech,
     'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.
SUFFOLK
     Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
     With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,
     As if she had suborned some to swear
     False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
QUEEN MARGARET
     But I can give the loser leave to chide.
GLOUCESTER
     Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;
     Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!
     And well such losers may have leave to speak.
BUCKINGHAM
     He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:
     Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.
CARDINAL
     Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
GLOUCESTER
     Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
     Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
     Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
     And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
     Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!
     For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
     Exit, guarded
KING HENRY VI
     My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,
     Do or undo, as if ourself were here.
QUEEN MARGARET
     What, will your highness leave the parliament?
KING HENRY VI
     Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
     Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
     My body round engirt with misery,
     For what's more miserable than discontent?
     Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see
     The map of honour, truth and loyalty:
     And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
     That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
     What louring star now envies thy estate,
     That these great lords and Margaret our queen
     Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
     Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
     And as the butcher takes away the calf
     And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
     Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
     Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
     And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
     Looking the way her harmless young one went,
     And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
     Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
     With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
     Look after him and cannot do him good,
     So mighty are his vowed enemies.
     His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan
     Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
     Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET
     remains apart
QUEEN MARGARET
     Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
     Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
     Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show
     Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
     With sorrow snares relenting passengers,
     Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,
     With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child
     That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
     Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--
     And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--
     This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
     To rid us of the fear we have of him.
CARDINAL
     That he should die is worthy policy;
     But yet we want a colour for his death:
     'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
SUFFOLK
     But, in my mind, that were no policy:
     The king will labour still to save his life,
     The commons haply rise, to save his life;
     And yet we have but trivial argument,
     More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
YORK
     So that, by this, you would not have him die.
SUFFOLK
     Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
YORK
     'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
     But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
     Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,
     Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set
     To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,
     As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?
QUEEN MARGARET
     So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
SUFFOLK
     Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,
     To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
     Who being accused a crafty murderer,
     His guilt should be but idly posted over,
     Because his purpose is not executed.
     No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
     By nature proved an enemy to the flock,
     Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
     As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
     And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
     Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
     Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
     So he be dead; for that is good deceit
     Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
SUFFOLK
     Not resolute, except so much were done;
     For things are often spoke and seldom meant:
     But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
     Seeing the deed is meritorious,
     And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
     Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
CARDINAL
     But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,
     Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
     Say you consent and censure well the deed,
     And I'll provide his executioner,
     I tender so the safety of my liege.
SUFFOLK
     Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.
QUEEN MARGARET
     And so say I.
YORK
     And I and now we three have spoke it,
     It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
     Enter a Post
Post
     Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,
     To signify that rebels there are up
     And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
     Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,
     Before the wound do grow uncurable;
     For, being green, there is great hope of help.
CARDINAL
     A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
     What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
YORK
     That Somerset be sent as regent thither:
     'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;
     Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
SOMERSET
     If York, with all his far-fet policy,
     Had been the regent there instead of me,
     He never would have stay'd in France so long.
YORK
     No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:
     I rather would have lost my life betimes
     Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
     By staying there so long till all were lost.
     Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
     Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
     If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:
     No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:
     Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,
     Might happily have proved far worse than his.
YORK
     What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!
SOMERSET
     And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!
CARDINAL
     My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
     The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
     And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:
     To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
     Collected choicely, from each county some,
     And try your hap against the Irishmen?
YORK
     I will, my lord, so please his majesty.
SUFFOLK
     Why, our authority is his consent,
     And what we do establish he confirms:
     Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.
YORK
     I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,
     Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
SUFFOLK
     A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
     But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
CARDINAL
     No more of him; for I will deal with him
     That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
     And so break off; the day is almost spent:
     Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.
YORK
     My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
     At Bristol I expect my soldiers;
     For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
SUFFOLK
     I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
     Exeunt all but YORK
YORK
     Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
     And change misdoubt to resolution:
     Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art
     Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:
     Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,
     And find no harbour in a royal heart.
     Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
     on thought,
     And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
     My brain more busy than the labouring spider
     Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
     Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,
     To send me packing with an host of men:
     I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
     Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting
     your hearts.
     'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:
     I take it kindly; and yet be well assured
     You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
     Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
     I will stir up in England some black storm
     Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
     And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
     Until the golden circuit on my head,
     Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
     Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
     And, for a minister of my intent,
     I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,
     John Cade of Ashford,
     To make commotion, as full well he can,
     Under the title of John Mortimer.
     In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
     Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
     And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
     Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;
     And, in the end being rescued, I have seen
     Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
     Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
     Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
     Hath he conversed with the enemy,
     And undiscover'd come to me again
     And given me notice of their villanies.
     This devil here shall be my substitute;
     For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
     In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:
     By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
     How they affect the house and claim of York.
     Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,
     I know no pain they can inflict upon him
     Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
     Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,
     Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
     And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
     For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
     And Henry put apart, the next for me.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state. ****
     Enter certain Murderers, hastily
First Murderer
     Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
     We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.
Second Murderer
     O that it were to do! What have we done?
     Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
     Enter SUFFOLK
First Murder
     Here comes my lord.
SUFFOLK
     Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
First Murderer
     Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
SUFFOLK
     Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;
     I will reward you for this venturous deed.
     The king and all the peers are here at hand.
     Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,
     According as I gave directions?
First Murderer
     'Tis, my good lord.
SUFFOLK
     Away! be gone.
     Exeunt Murderers
     Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL,
     SOMERSET, with Attendants
KING HENRY VI
     Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;
     Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
     If he be guilty, as 'tis published.
SUFFOLK
     I'll call him presently, my noble lord.
     Exit
KING HENRY VI
     Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
     Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester
     Than from true evidence of good esteem
     He be approved in practise culpable.
QUEEN MARGARET
     God forbid any malice should prevail,
     That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
     Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
KING HENRY VI
     I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.
     Re-enter SUFFOLK
     How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
     Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?
SUFFOLK
     Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Marry, God forfend!
CARDINAL
     God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
     The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
     KING HENRY VI swoons
QUEEN MARGARET
     How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
SOMERSET
     Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
SUFFOLK
     He doth revive again: madam, be patient.
KING HENRY VI
     O heavenly God!
QUEEN MARGARET
     How fares my gracious lord?
SUFFOLK
     Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!
KING HENRY VI
     What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
     Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
     Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;
     And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
     By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
     Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
     Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;
     Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;
     Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
     Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
     Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
     Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.
     Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:
     Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,
     And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
     For in the shade of death I shall find joy;
     In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
     Although the duke was enemy to him,
     Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:
     And for myself, foe as he was to me,
     Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
     Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
     I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
     Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
     And all to have the noble duke alive.
     What know I how the world may deem of me?
     For it is known we were but hollow friends:
     It may be judged I made the duke away;
     So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
     And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
     This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!
     To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!
KING HENRY VI
     Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
     What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
     I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
     What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
     Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
     Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
     Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
     Erect his statue and worship it,
     And make my image but an alehouse sign.
     Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
     And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
     Drove back again unto my native clime?
     What boded this, but well forewarning wind
     Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
     Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
     What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts
     And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
     And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
     Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
     Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,
     But left that hateful office unto thee:
     The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,
     Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
     With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:
     The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
     And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
     Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
     Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
     As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
     When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
     I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
     And when the dusky sky began to rob
     My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
     I took a costly jewel from my neck,
     A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
     And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,
     And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
     And even with this I lost fair England's view
     And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
     And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,
     For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
     How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
     The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
     To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
     When he to madding Dido would unfold
     His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
     Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
     Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!
     For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
     Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons
WARWICK
     It is reported, mighty sovereign,
     That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd
     By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
     The commons, like an angry hive of bees
     That want their leader, scatter up and down
     And care not who they sting in his revenge.
     Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,
     Until they hear the order of his death.
KING HENRY VI
     That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
     But how he died God knows, not Henry:
     Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
     And comment then upon his sudden death.
WARWICK
     That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
     With the rude multitude till I return.
     Exit
KING HENRY VI
     O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,
     My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul
     Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
     If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,
     For judgment only doth belong to thee.
     Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
     With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain
     Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
     To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,
     And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:
     But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
     And to survey his dead and earthly image,
     What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
     Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed
WARWICK
     Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
KING HENRY VI
     That is to see how deep my grave is made;
     For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
     For seeing him I see my life in death.
WARWICK
     As surely as my soul intends to live
     With that dread King that took our state upon him
     To free us from his father's wrathful curse,
     I do believe that violent hands were laid
     Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
SUFFOLK
     A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
     What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
WARWICK
     See how the blood is settled in his face.
     Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
     Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,
     Being all descended to the labouring heart;
     Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
     Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;
     Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
     To blush and beautify the cheek again.
     But see, his face is black and full of blood,
     His eye-balls further out than when he lived,
     Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
     His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;
     His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd
     And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:
     Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;
     His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,
     Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.
     It cannot be but he was murder'd here;
     The least of all these signs were probable.
SUFFOLK
     Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?
     Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;
     And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
WARWICK
     But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,
     And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:
     'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
     And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen
     As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
WARWICK
     Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
     And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
     But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
     Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,
     But may imagine how the bird was dead,
     Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
     Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?
     Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?
SUFFOLK
     I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
     But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
     That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
     That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
     Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,
     That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
     Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others
WARWICK
     What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
QUEEN MARGARET
     He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
     Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,
     Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
WARWICK
     Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;
     For every word you speak in his behalf
     Is slander to your royal dignity.
SUFFOLK
     Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!
     If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,
     Thy mother took into her blameful bed
     Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock
     Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,
     And never of the Nevils' noble race.
WARWICK
     But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
     And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
     Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
     And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
     I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee
     Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,
     And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
     That thou thyself was born in bastardy;
     And after all this fearful homage done,
     Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,
     Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
SUFFOLK
     Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,
     If from this presence thou darest go with me.
WARWICK
     Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:
     Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee
     And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
     Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
KING HENRY VI
     What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
     Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
     And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel
     Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
     A noise within
QUEEN MARGARET
     What noise is this?
     Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn
KING HENRY VI
     Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn
     Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
     Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
SUFFOLK
     The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
     Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.
SALISBURY
     [To the Commons, entering] Sirs, stand apart;
     the king shall know your mind.
     Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,
     Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
     Or banished fair England's territories,
     They will by violence tear him from your palace
     And torture him with grievous lingering death.
     They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
     They say, in him they fear your highness' death;
     And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
     Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
     As being thought to contradict your liking,
     Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
     They say, in care of your most royal person,
     That if your highness should intend to sleep
     And charge that no man should disturb your rest
     In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
     Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
     Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
     That slily glided towards your majesty,
     It were but necessary you were waked,
     Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,
     The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;
     And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
     That they will guard you, whether you will or no,
     From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,
     With whose envenomed and fatal sting,
     Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
     They say, is shamefully bereft of life.
Commons
     [Within] An answer from the king, my
     Lord of Salisbury!
SUFFOLK
     'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,
     Could send such message to their sovereign:
     But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,
     To show how quaint an orator you are:
     But all the honour Salisbury hath won
     Is, that he was the lord ambassador
     Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
Commons
     [Within] An answer from the king, or we will all break in!
KING HENRY VI
     Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.
     I thank them for their tender loving care;
     And had I not been cited so by them,
     Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
     For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy
     Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
     And therefore, by His majesty I swear,
     Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
     He shall not breathe infection in this air
     But three days longer, on the pain of death.
     Exit SALISBURY
QUEEN MARGARET
     O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
KING HENRY VI
     Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
     No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,
     Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
     Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
     But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
     If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found
     On any ground that I am ruler of,
     The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
     Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
     I have great matters to impart to thee.
     Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
QUEEN MARGARET
     Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
     Heart's discontent and sour affliction
     Be playfellows to keep you company!
     There's two of you; the devil make a third!
     And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
SUFFOLK
     Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,
     And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!
     Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
SUFFOLK
     A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
     Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,
     I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
     As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
     Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
     With full as many signs of deadly hate,
     As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
     My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
     Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
     Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
     Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
     And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
     Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
     Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
     Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
     Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
     Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
     Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
     And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
     All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
QUEEN MARGARET
     Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;
     And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
     Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,
     And turn the force of them upon thyself.
SUFFOLK
     You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
     Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
     Well could I curse away a winter's night,
     Though standing naked on a mountain top,
     Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
     And think it but a minute spent in sport.
QUEEN MARGARET
     O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,
     That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
     Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
     To wash away my woful monuments.
     O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
     That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
     Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!
     So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;
     'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,
     As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
     I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,
     Adventure to be banished myself:
     And banished I am, if but from thee.
     Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
     O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd
     Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
     Loather a hundred times to part than die.
     Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!
SUFFOLK
     Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;
     Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.
     'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
     A wilderness is populous enough,
     So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
     For where thou art, there is the world itself,
     With every several pleasure in the world,
     And where thou art not, desolation.
     I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;
     Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.
     Enter VAUX
QUEEN MARGARET
     Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?
VAUX
     To signify unto his majesty
     That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;
     For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,
     That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,
     Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
     Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
     Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,
     And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
     The secrets of his overcharged soul;
     And I am sent to tell his majesty
     That even now he cries aloud for him.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Go tell this heavy message to the king.
     Exit VAUX
     Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
     But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,
     Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?
     Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
     And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
     Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?
     Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;
     If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.
SUFFOLK
     If I depart from thee, I cannot live;
     And in thy sight to die, what were it else
     But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
     Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
     As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
     Dying with mother's dug between its lips:
     Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
     And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
     To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;
     So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
     Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
     And then it lived in sweet Elysium.
     To die by thee were but to die in jest;
     From thee to die were torture more than death:
     O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,
     It is applied to a deathful wound.
     To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;
     For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,
     I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
SUFFOLK
     I go.
QUEEN MARGARET
     And take my heart with thee.
SUFFOLK
     A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask
     That ever did contain a thing of worth.
     Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we
     This way fall I to death.
QUEEN MARGARET
     This way for me.
     Exeunt severally
**** SCENE III. A bedchamber. ****
     Enter the KING, SALISBURY, WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed
KING HENRY VI
     How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to
     thy sovereign.
CARDINAL
     If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,
     Enough to purchase such another island,
     So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.
KING HENRY VI
     Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,
     Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
WARWICK
     Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
CARDINAL
     Bring me unto my trial when you will.
     Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
     Can I make men live, whether they will or no?
     O, torture me no more! I will confess.
     Alive again? then show me where he is:
     I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
     He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
     Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,
     Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
     Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary
     Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
KING HENRY VI
     O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.
     Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
     O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
     That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.
     And from his bosom purge this black despair!
WARWICK
     See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!
SALISBURY
     Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.
KING HENRY VI
     Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
     Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,
     Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
     He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!
WARWICK
     So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
KING HENRY VI
     Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
     Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
     And let us all to meditation.
     Exeunt
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. The coast of Kent. ****
     Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a Captain, a Master, a
     Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE, and others; with them SUFFOLK, and
     others, prisoners
Captain
     The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day
     Is crept into the bosom of the sea;
     And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
     That drag the tragic melancholy night;
     Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,
     Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
     Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
     Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;
     For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,
     Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
     Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.
     Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;
     And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;
     The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.
First Gentleman
     What is my ransom, master? let me know.
Master
     A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
     Master's-Mate And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
Captain
     What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
     And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
     Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:
     The lives of those which we have lost in fight
     Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!
First Gentleman
     I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.
Second Gentleman
     And so will I and write home for it straight.
WHITMORE
     I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
     And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;
     To SUFFOLK
     And so should these, if I might have my will.
Captain
     Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
SUFFOLK
     Look on my George; I am a gentleman:
     Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
WHITMORE
     And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
     How now! why start'st thou? what, doth
     death affright?
SUFFOLK
     Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
     A cunning man did calculate my birth
     And told me that by water I should die:
     Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
     Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.
WHITMORE
     Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:
     Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,
     But with our sword we wiped away the blot;
     Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
     Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,
     And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
SUFFOLK
     Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,
     The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
WHITMORE
     The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
SUFFOLK
     Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:
     Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?
Captain
     But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
SUFFOLK
     Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
     The honourable blood of Lancaster,
     Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
     Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
     Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
     And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
     How often hast thou waited at my cup,
     Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
     When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
     Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,
     Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;
     How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
     And duly waited for my coming forth?
     This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
     And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
WHITMORE
     Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
Captain
     First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
SUFFOLK
     Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.
Captain
     Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
     Strike off his head.
SUFFOLK
     Thou darest not, for thy own.
Captain
     Yes, Pole.
SUFFOLK
     Pole!
Captain
     Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
     Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt
     Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
     Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
     For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
     Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;
     And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,
     Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
     Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
     And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
     For daring to affy a mighty lord
     Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
     Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
     By devilish policy art thou grown great,
     And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged
     With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
     By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
     The false revolting Normans thorough thee
     Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
     Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,
     And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
     The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
     Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
     As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
     And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
     By shameful murder of a guiltless king
     And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
     Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours
     Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,
     Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'
     The commons here in Kent are up in arms:
     And, to conclude, reproach and beggary
     Is crept into the palace of our king.
     And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
SUFFOLK
     O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
     Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
     Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
     Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
     Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
     Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:
     It is impossible that I should die
     By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
     Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:
     I go of message from the queen to France;
     I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
Captain
     Walter,--
WHITMORE
     Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
SUFFOLK
     Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
WHITMORE
     Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
     What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
First Gentleman
     My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
SUFFOLK
     Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
     Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.
     Far be it we should honour such as these
     With humble suit: no, rather let my head
     Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
     Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
     And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
     Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
     True nobility is exempt from fear:
     More can I bear than you dare execute.
Captain
     Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
SUFFOLK
     Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
     That this my death may never be forgot!
     Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
     A Roman sworder and banditto slave
     Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
     Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders
     Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.
     Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk
Captain
     And as for these whose ransom we have set,
     It is our pleasure one of them depart;
     Therefore come you with us and let him go.
     Exeunt all but the First Gentleman
     Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body
WHITMORE
     There let his head and lifeless body lie,
     Until the queen his mistress bury it.
     Exit
First Gentleman
     O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
     His body will I bear unto the king:
     If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
     So will the queen, that living held him dear.
     Exit with the body
**** SCENE II. Blackheath. ****
     Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND
BEVIS
     Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;
     they have been up these two days.
HOLLAND
     They have the more need to sleep now, then.
BEVIS
     I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress
     the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
HOLLAND
     So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it
     was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
BEVIS
     O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
HOLLAND
     The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
BEVIS
     Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.
HOLLAND
     True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;
     which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be
     labouring men; and therefore should we be
     magistrates.
BEVIS
     Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a
     brave mind than a hard hand.
HOLLAND
     I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the
     tanner of Wingham,--
BEVIS
     He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make
     dog's-leather of.
HOLLAND
     And Dick the Butcher,--
BEVIS
     Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's
     throat cut like a calf.
HOLLAND
     And Smith the weaver,--
BEVIS
     Argo, their thread of life is spun.
HOLLAND
     Come, come, let's fall in with them.
     Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the Weaver, and a Sawyer,
     with infinite numbers
CADE
     We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--
DICK
     [Aside] Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.
CADE
     For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with
     the spirit of putting down kings and princes,
     --Command silence.
DICK
     Silence!
CADE
     My father was a Mortimer,--
DICK
     [Aside] He was an honest man, and a good
     bricklayer.
CADE
     My mother a Plantagenet,--
DICK
     [Aside] I knew her well; she was a midwife.
CADE
     My wife descended of the Lacies,--
DICK
     [Aside] She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and
     sold many laces.
SMITH
     [Aside] But now of late, notable to travel with her
     furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.
CADE
     Therefore am I of an honourable house.
DICK
     [Aside] Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;
     and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his
     father had never a house but the cage.
CADE
     Valiant I am.
SMITH
     [Aside] A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.
CADE
     I am able to endure much.
DICK
     [Aside] No question of that; for I have seen him
     whipped three market-days together.
CADE
     I fear neither sword nor fire.
SMITH
     [Aside] He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.
DICK
     [Aside] But methinks he should stand in fear of
     fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.
CADE
     Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows
     reformation. There shall be in England seven
     halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped
     pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony
     to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in
     common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to
     grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,--
ALL
     God save your majesty!
CADE
     I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;
     all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will
     apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree
     like brothers and worship me their lord.
DICK
     The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
CADE
     Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable
     thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
     be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled
     o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:
     but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal
     once to a thing, and I was never mine own man
     since. How now! who's there?
     Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham
SMITH
     The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and
     cast accompt.
CADE
     O monstrous!
SMITH
     We took him setting of boys' copies.
CADE
     Here's a villain!
SMITH
     Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
CADE
     Nay, then, he is a conjurer.
DICK
     Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.
CADE
     I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine
     honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.
     Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?
Clerk
     Emmanuel.
DICK
     They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill
     go hard with you.
CADE
     Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or
     hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest
     plain-dealing man?
CLERK
     Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up
     that I can write my name.
ALL
     He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain
     and a traitor.
CADE
     Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen and
     ink-horn about his neck.
     Exit one with the Clerk
     Enter MICHAEL
MICHAEL
     Where's our general?
CADE
     Here I am, thou particular fellow.
MICHAEL
     Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his
     brother are hard by, with the king's forces.
CADE
     Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He
     shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:
     he is but a knight, is a'?
MICHAEL
     No.
CADE
     To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.
     Kneels
     Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
     Rises
     Now have at him!
     Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, with drum and soldiers
SIR HUMPHREY
     Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
     Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;
     Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:
     The king is merciful, if you revolt.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
     But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,
     If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.
CADE
     As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:
     It is to you, good people, that I speak,
     Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;
     For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
SIR HUMPHREY
     Villain, thy father was a plasterer;
     And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
CADE
     And Adam was a gardener.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
     And what of that?
CADE
     Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.
     Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?
SIR HUMPHREY
     Ay, sir.
CADE
     By her he had two children at one birth.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
     That's false.
CADE
     Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:
     The elder of them, being put to nurse,
     Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;
     And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
     Became a bricklayer when he came to age:
     His son am I; deny it, if you can.
DICK
     Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.
SMITH
     Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and
     the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;
     therefore deny it not.
SIR HUMPHREY
     And will you credit this base drudge's words,
     That speaks he knows not what?
ALL
     Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
     Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
CADE
     [Aside] He lies, for I invented it myself.
     Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his
     father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys
     went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content
     he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.
DICK
     And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for
     selling the dukedom of Maine.
CADE
     And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and
     fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds
     it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say
     hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:
     and more than that, he can speak French; and
     therefore he is a traitor.
SIR HUMPHREY
     O gross and miserable ignorance!
CADE
     Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our
     enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that
     speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
     counsellor, or no?
ALL
     No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
WILLIAM STAFFORD
     Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
     Assail them with the army of the king.
SIR HUMPHREY
     Herald, away; and throughout every town
     Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
     That those which fly before the battle ends
     May, even in their wives' and children's sight,
     Be hang'd up for example at their doors:
     And you that be the king's friends, follow me.
     Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers
CADE
     And you that love the commons, follow me.
     Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.
     We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:
     Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;
     For they are thrifty honest men, and such
     As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.
DICK
     They are all in order and march toward us.
CADE
     But then are we in order when we are most
     out of order. Come, march forward.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Another part of Blackheath. ****
     Alarums to the fight, wherein SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are
     slain. Enter CADE and the rest
CADE
     Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?
DICK
     Here, sir.
CADE
     They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou
     behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own
     slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,
     the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou
     shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking
     one.
DICK
     I desire no more.
CADE
     And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This
     monument of the victory will I bear;
     Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine
     and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels
     till I do come to London, where we will have the
     mayor's sword borne before us.
DICK
     If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the
     gaols and let out the prisoners.
CADE
     Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's march
     towards London.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. The palace. ****
     Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S
     head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY
QUEEN MARGARET
     Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
     And makes it fearful and degenerate;
     Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
     But who can cease to weep and look on this?
     Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:
     But where's the body that I should embrace?
BUCKINGHAM
     What answer makes your grace to the rebels'
     supplication?
KING HENRY VI
     I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;
     For God forbid so many simple souls
     Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
     Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
     Will parley with Jack Cade their general:
     But stay, I'll read it over once again.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face
     Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,
     And could it not enforce them to relent,
     That were unworthy to behold the same?
KING HENRY VI
     Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.
SAY
     Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.
KING HENRY VI
     How now, madam!
     Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
     I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
     Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.
QUEEN MARGARET
     No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.
     Enter a Messenger
KING HENRY VI
     How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?
Messenger
     The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
     Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
     Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,
     And calls your grace usurper openly
     And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
     His army is a ragged multitude
     Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:
     Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death
     Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:
     All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
     They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.
KING HENRY VI
     O graceless men! they know not what they do.
BUCKINGHAM
     My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,
     Until a power be raised to put them down.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,
     These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
KING HENRY VI
     Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;
     Therefore away with us to Killingworth.
SAY
     So might your grace's person be in danger.
     The sight of me is odious in their eyes;
     And therefore in this city will I stay
     And live alone as secret as I may.
     Enter another Messenger
Messenger
     Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:
     The citizens fly and forsake their houses:
     The rascal people, thirsting after prey,
     Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear
     To spoil the city and your royal court.
BUCKINGHAM
     Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.
KING HENRY VI
     Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.
QUEEN MARGARET
     My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
KING HENRY VI
     Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.
BUCKINGHAM
     Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.
SAY
     The trust I have is in mine innocence,
     And therefore am I bold and resolute.

     Citizens below
SCALES
     How now! is Jack Cade slain?
First Citizen
     No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have
     won the bridge, killing all those that withstand
     them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from
     the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.
SCALES
     Such aid as I can spare you shall command;
     But I am troubled here with them myself;
     The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.
     But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,
     And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;
     Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
     And so, farewell, for I must hence again.

DICK
     My lord, there's an army gathered together in
     Smithfield.
CADE
     Come, then, let's go fight with them; but first, go

DICK
     I have a suit unto your lordship.
CADE
     Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.
DICK
     Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.
HOLLAND
     [Aside] Mass, 'twill be sore law, then; for he was
     thrust in the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not whole
     yet.
SMITH
     [Aside] Nay, John, it will be stinking law for his
     breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.
CADE
     I have thought upon it, it shall be so. Away, burn
     all the records of the realm: my mouth shall be
     the parliament of England.
HOLLAND
     [Aside] Then we are like to have biting statutes,
     unless his teeth be pulled out.
CADE

Messenger
     My lord, a prize, a prize! here's the Lord Say,
     which sold the towns in France; he that made us pay
     one and twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the
     pound, the last subsidy.
     Enter BEVIS, with Lord SAY
CADE
     Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,
     thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now
     art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
     regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for
     giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the
     dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these
     presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I
     am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such
     filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously
     corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
     grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers
     had no other books but the score and the tally, thou
     hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to
     the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a
     paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou
     hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
     a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian
     ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed
     justices of peace, to call poor men before them
     about matters they were not able to answer.
     Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because
     they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,
     indeed, only for that cause they have been most
     worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?
SAY
     What of that?
CADE
     Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a
     cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose
     and doublets.
DICK
     And work in their shirt too; as myself, for example,
     that am a butcher.
SAY
     You men of Kent,--
DICK
     What say you of Kent?
SAY
     Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'
CADE
     Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.
SAY
     Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
     Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
     Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:
     Sweet is the country, because full of riches;
     The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;
     Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
     I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,
     Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.
     Justice with favour have I always done;
     Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.
     When have I aught exacted at your hands,
     But to maintain the king, the realm and you?
     Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,
     Because my book preferr'd me to the king,
     And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
     Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
     Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,
     You cannot but forbear to murder me:
     This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
     For your behoof,--
CADE
     Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
SAY
     Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
     Those that I never saw and struck them dead.
BEVIS
     O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?
SAY
     These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.
CADE
     Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.
SAY
     Long sitting to determine poor men's causes
     Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.
CADE
     Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.
DICK
     Why dost thou quiver, man?
SAY
     The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.
CADE
     Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be even
     with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier
     on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.
SAY
     Tell me wherein have I offended most?
     Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.
     Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
     Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
     Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?
     These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,
     This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.
     O, let me live!
CADE
     [Aside] I feel remorse in myself with his words;
     but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be but for
     pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he
     has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'
     God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike
     off his head presently; and then break into his
     son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off
     his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.
ALL
     It shall be done.
SAY
     Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,
     God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
     How would it fare with your departed souls?
     And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
CADE
     Away with him! and do as I command ye.
     Exeunt some with Lord SAY
     The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head
     on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute; there
     shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me
     her maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold of
     me in capite; and we charge and command that their
     wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.
DICK
     My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take up
     commodities upon our bills?
CADE
     Marry, presently.
ALL
     O, brave!
     Re-enter one with the heads
CADE
     But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,
     for they loved well when they were alive. Now part
     them again, lest they consult about the giving up of
     some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the
     spoil of the city until night: for with these borne
     before us, instead of maces, will we ride through
     the streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!

BUCKINGHAM
     Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee:
     Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king
     Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
     And here pronounce free pardon to them all
     That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
CLIFFORD
     What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,
     And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;
     Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
     Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,
     Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'
     Who hateth him and honours not his father,
     Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,
     Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.
ALL
     God save the king! God save the king!
CADE
     What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave? And
     you, base peasants, do ye believe him? will you
     needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?
     Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,
     that you should leave me at the White Hart in
     Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out
     these arms till you had recovered your ancient
     freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,
     and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let
     them break your backs with burthens, take your
     houses over your heads, ravish your wives and
     daughters before your faces: for me, I will make
     shift for one; and so, God's curse light upon you
     all!
ALL
     We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
CLIFFORD
     Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,
     That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?
     Will he conduct you through the heart of France,
     And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?
     Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to;
     Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
     Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
     Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,
     The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,
     Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?
     Methinks already in this civil broil
     I see them lording it in London streets,
     Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.
     Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry
     Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.
     To France, to France, and get what you have lost;
     Spare England, for it is your native coast;
     Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;
     God on our side, doubt not of victory.
ALL
     A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.
CADE
     Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
     multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them
     to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me
     desolate. I see them lay their heads together to
     surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is
     no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have
     through the very middest of you? and heavens and
     honour be witness, that no want of resolution in me.

     The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,
     And with a puissant and a mighty power
     Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
     Is marching hitherward in proud array,
     And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
     His arms are only to remove from thee
     The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.
KING HENRY VI
     Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.
     Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,
     Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:
     But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;
     And now is York in arms to second him.
     I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
     And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
     Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;
     And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,
     Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
SOMERSET
     My lord,
     I'll yield myself to prison willingly,
     Or unto death, to do my country good.

**** SCENE X. Kent. IDEN's garden. ****
     Enter CADE
CADE
     Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,
     and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I
     hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for
     all the country is laid for me; but now am I so
     hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a
     thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,
     on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to
     see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another
     while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach
     this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'
     was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a
     sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
     bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and
     bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a
     quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'
     must serve me to feed on.
     Enter IDEN
IDEN
     Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,
     And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
     This small inheritance my father left me
     Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.
     I seek not to wax great by others' waning,
     Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:
     Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
     And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
CADE
     Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a
     stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.
     Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand
     crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but
     I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow
     my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.
IDEN
     Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
     I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?
     Is't not enough to break into my garden,
     And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
     Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,
     But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?
CADE
     Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was
     broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I
     have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and
     thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead
     as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.
IDEN
     Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
     That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,
     Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
     Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,
     See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:
     Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;
     Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
     Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;
     My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
     And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
     Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
     As for words, whose greatness answers words,
     Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
CADE
     By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I
     heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out
     the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
     sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou
     mayst be turned to hobnails.
     Here they fight. CADE falls
     O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:
     let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me
     but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them
     all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a
     burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,
     because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
IDEN
     Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
     Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,
     And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:
     Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;
     But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,
     To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
CADE
     Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell
     Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort
     all the world to be cowards; for I, that never
     feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.
     Dies
IDEN
     How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
     Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;
     And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
     So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.
     Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
     Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
     And there cut off thy most ungracious head;
     Which I will bear in triumph to the king,
     Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

     This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
     I cannot give due action to my words,

     Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?
BUCKINGHAM

     To know the reason of these arms in peace;
     Or why thou, being a subject as I am,
     Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
     Should raise so great a power without his leave,

     On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
     I am far better born than is the king,
     More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:
     But I must make fair weather yet a while,
     Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--
     Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
     That I have given no answer all this while;
     My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
     The cause why I have brought this army hither
     Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
     Seditious to his grace and to the state.
BUCKINGHAM
     That is too much presumption on thy part:
     But if thy arms be to no other end,
     The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
     The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
YORK
     Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
BUCKINGHAM
     Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
YORK
     Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
     Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
     Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,
     You shall have pay and every thing you wish.
     And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,
     Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
     As pledges of my fealty and love;
     I'll send them all as willing as I live:
     Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,
     Is his to use, so Somerset may die.
BUCKINGHAM
     York, I commend this kind submission:
     We twain will go into his highness' tent.
     Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants
KING HENRY VI
     Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
     That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
YORK
     In all submission and humility
     York doth present himself unto your highness.
KING HENRY VI
     Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
YORK
     To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
     And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
     Who since I heard to be discomfited.
     Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head
IDEN
     If one so rude and of so mean condition
     May pass into the presence of a king,
     Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,
     The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.
KING HENRY VI
     The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!
     O, let me view his visage, being dead,
     That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
     Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?
IDEN
     I was, an't like your majesty.
KING HENRY VI
     How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?
IDEN
     Alexander Iden, that's my name;
     A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.
BUCKINGHAM
     So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
     He were created knight for his good service.
KING HENRY VI
     Iden, kneel down.
     He kneels
     Rise up a knight.
     We give thee for reward a thousand marks,
     And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
IDEN
     May Iden live to merit such a bounty.
     And never live but true unto his liege!
     Rises
     Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET
KING HENRY VI
     See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:
     Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.
QUEEN MARGARET
     For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
     But boldly stand and front him to his face.
YORK
     How now! is Somerset at liberty?
     Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,
     And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
     Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
     False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,
     Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
     King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
     Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
     Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
     That head of thine doth not become a crown;
     Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
     And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
     That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
     Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
     Is able with the change to kill and cure.
     Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
     And with the same to act controlling laws.
     Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more
     O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
SOMERSET
     O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
     Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;
     Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.
YORK
     Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,
     If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
     Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
     Exit Attendant
     I know, ere they will have me go to ward,
     They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,
     To say if that the bastard boys of York
     Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
     Exit BUCKINGHAM
YORK
     O blood-besotted Neapolitan,
     Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
     The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,
     Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those
     That for my surety will refuse the boys!
     Enter EDWARD and RICHARD
     See where they come: I'll warrant they'll
     make it good.
     Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD
QUEEN MARGARET
     And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
CLIFFORD
     Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
     Kneels
YORK
     I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?
     Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;
     We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;
     For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.
CLIFFORD
     This is my king, York, I do not mistake;
     But thou mistakest me much to think I do:
     To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
KING HENRY VI
     Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
     Makes him oppose himself against his king.
CLIFFORD
     He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,
     And chop away that factious pate of his.
QUEEN MARGARET
     He is arrested, but will not obey;
     His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.
YORK
     Will you not, sons?
EDWARD
     Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
RICHARD
     And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
CLIFFORD
     Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
YORK
     Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
     I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.
     Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
     That with the very shaking of their chains
     They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
     Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
     Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY
CLIFFORD
     Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.
     And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,
     If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.
RICHARD
     Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
     Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
     Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,
     Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:
     And such a piece of service will you do,
     If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
CLIFFORD
     Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
     As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
YORK
     Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
CLIFFORD
     Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
     Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
     Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
     What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,
     And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
     O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
     If it be banish'd from the frosty head,
     Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
     Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
     And shame thine honourable age with blood?
     Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
     Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?
     For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me
     That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
SALISBURY
     My lord, I have consider'd with myself
     The title of this most renowned duke;
     And in my conscience do repute his grace
     The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
KING HENRY VI
     Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
SALISBURY
     I have.
KING HENRY VI
     Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
SALISBURY
     It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
     But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
     Who can be bound by any solemn vow
     To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,
     To force a spotless virgin's chastity,
     To reave the orphan of his patrimony,
     To wring the widow from her custom'd right,
     And have no other reason for this wrong
     But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
QUEEN MARGARET
     A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
KING HENRY VI
     Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
YORK
     Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
     I am resolved for death or dignity.
CLIFFORD
     The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
WARWICK
     You were best to go to bed and dream again,
     To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
CLIFFORD
     I am resolved to bear a greater storm
     Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;
     And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,
     Might I but know thee by thy household badge.
WARWICK
     Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
     The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,
     This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,
     As on a mountain top the cedar shows
     That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
     Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
CLIFFORD
     And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
     And tread it under foot with all contempt,
     Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.
YOUNG CLIFFORD
     And so to arms, victorious father,
     To quell the rebels and their complices.
RICHARD
     Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,
     For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.
YOUNG CLIFFORD
     Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
RICHARD
     If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.
     Exeunt severally
**** SCENE II. Saint Alban's. ****
     Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK
WARWICK
     Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:
     And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
     Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
     And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
     Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:
     Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,
     Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
     Enter YORK
     How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
YORK
     The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,
     But match to match I have encounter'd him
     And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
     Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
     Enter CLIFFORD
WARWICK
     Of one or both of us the time is come.
YORK
     Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
     For I myself must hunt this deer to death.
WARWICK
     Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
     As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,
     It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.
     Exit
CLIFFORD
     What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?
YORK
     With thy brave bearing should I be in love,
     But that thou art so fast mine enemy.
CLIFFORD
     Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
     But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
YORK
     So let it help me now against thy sword
     As I in justice and true right express it.
CLIFFORD
     My soul and body on the action both!
YORK
     A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
     They fight, and CLIFFORD falls
CLIFFORD
     La fin couronne les oeuvres.
     Dies
YORK
     Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.
     Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!
     Exit
     Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
YOUNG CLIFFORD
     Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;
     Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
     Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,
     Whom angry heavens do make their minister
     Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
     Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
     He that is truly dedicate to war
     Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself
     Hath not essentially but by circumstance
     The name of valour.
     Seeing his dead father
     O, let the vile world end,
     And the premised flames of the last day
     Knit earth and heaven together!
     Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
     Particularities and petty sounds
     To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,
     To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve
     The silver livery of advised age,
     And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus
     To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
     My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,
     It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
     No more will I their babes: tears virginal
     Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,
     And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
     Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
     Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
     Meet I an infant of the house of York,
     Into as many gobbets will I cut it
     As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
     In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
     Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:
     As did AEneas old Anchises bear,
     So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
     But then AEneas bare a living load,
     Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.
     Exit, bearing off his father
     Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed
RICHARD
     So, lie thou there;
     For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,
     The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset
     Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
     Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:
     Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
     Exit
     Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and others
QUEEN MARGARET
     Away, my lord! you are slow; for shame, away!
KING HENRY VI
     Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.
QUEEN MARGARET
     What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
     Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
     To give the enemy way, and to secure us
     By what we can, which can no more but fly.
     Alarum afar off
     If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
     Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,
     As well we may, if not through your neglect,
     We shall to London get, where you are loved
     And where this breach now in our fortunes made
     May readily be stopp'd.
     Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
YOUNG CLIFFORD
     But that my heart's on future mischief set,
     I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:
     But fly you must; uncurable discomfit
     Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
     Away, for your relief! and we will live
     To see their day and them our fortune give:
     Away, my lord, away!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's. ****
     Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with
     drum and colours
YORK
     Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
     That winter lion, who in rage forgets
     Aged contusions and all brush of time,
     And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
     Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
     Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
     If Salisbury be lost.
RICHARD
     My noble father,
     Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,
     Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,
     Persuaded him from any further act:
     But still, where danger was, still there I met him;
     And like rich hangings in a homely house,
     So was his will in his old feeble body.
     But, noble as he is, look where he comes.
     Enter SALISBURY
SALISBURY
     Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;
     By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:
     God knows how long it is I have to live;
     And it hath pleased him that three times to-day
     You have defended me from imminent death.
     Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:
     'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
     Being opposites of such repairing nature.
YORK
     I know our safety is to follow them;
     For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,
     To call a present court of parliament.
     Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
     What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
WARWICK
     After them! nay, before them, if we can.
     Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:
     Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
     Shall be eternized in all age to come.
     Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:
     And more such days as these to us befall!
     Exeunt
