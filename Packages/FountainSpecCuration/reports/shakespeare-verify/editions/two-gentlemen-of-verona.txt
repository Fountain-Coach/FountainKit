Two Gentlemen of Verona
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. Verona. An open place. ****
     Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
VALENTINE
     Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
     Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
     Were't not affection chains thy tender days
     To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
     I rather would entreat thy company
     To see the wonders of the world abroad,
     Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
     Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
     But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
     Even as I would when I to love begin.
PROTEUS
     Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
     Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
     Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
     Wish me partaker in thy happiness
     When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
     If ever danger do environ thee,
     Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
     For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
VALENTINE
     And on a love-book pray for my success?
PROTEUS
     Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
VALENTINE
     That's on some shallow story of deep love:
     How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
PROTEUS
     That's a deep story of a deeper love:
     For he was more than over shoes in love.
VALENTINE
     'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
     And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
PROTEUS
     Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
VALENTINE
     No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
PROTEUS
     What?
VALENTINE
     To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
     Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
     With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
     If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
     If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
     However, but a folly bought with wit,
     Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
PROTEUS
     So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
VALENTINE
     So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
PROTEUS
     'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
VALENTINE
     Love is your master, for he masters you:
     And he that is so yoked by a fool,
     Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
PROTEUS
     Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
     The eating canker dwells, so eating love
     Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
VALENTINE
     And writers say, as the most forward bud
     Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
     Even so by love the young and tender wit
     Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
     Losing his verdure even in the prime
     And all the fair effects of future hopes.
     But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
     That art a votary to fond desire?
     Once more adieu! my father at the road
     Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
PROTEUS
     And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
VALENTINE
     Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
     To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
     Of thy success in love, and what news else
     Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
     And likewise will visit thee with mine.
PROTEUS
     All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
VALENTINE
     As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
     Exit
PROTEUS
     He after honour hunts, I after love:
     He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
     I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
     Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
     Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
     War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
     Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
     Enter SPEED
SPEED
     Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
PROTEUS
     But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
SPEED
     Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
     And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
PROTEUS
     Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
     An if the shepherd be a while away.
SPEED
     You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
     and I a sheep?
PROTEUS
     I do.
SPEED
     Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
PROTEUS
     A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
SPEED
     This proves me still a sheep.
PROTEUS
     True; and thy master a shepherd.
SPEED
     Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
PROTEUS
     It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
SPEED
     The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
     shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
     not me: therefore I am no sheep.
PROTEUS
     The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
     shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
     wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
     follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
SPEED
     Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
PROTEUS
     But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
SPEED
     Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
     a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
     lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
PROTEUS
     Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
SPEED
     If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
PROTEUS
     Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
SPEED
     Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
     carrying your letter.
PROTEUS
     You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
SPEED
     From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
     'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
     your lover.
PROTEUS
     But what said she?
SPEED
     [First nodding] Ay.
PROTEUS
     Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
SPEED
     You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
     me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
PROTEUS
     And that set together is noddy.
SPEED
     Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
     take it for your pains.
PROTEUS
     No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
SPEED
     Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
PROTEUS
     Why sir, how do you bear with me?
SPEED
     Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
     but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
PROTEUS
     Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
SPEED
     And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
PROTEUS
     Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
SPEED
     Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
     be both at once delivered.
PROTEUS
     Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
SPEED
     Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
PROTEUS
     Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
SPEED
     Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
     not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
     and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
     fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
     mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
     hard as steel.
PROTEUS
     What said she? nothing?
SPEED
     No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
     testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
     me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
     letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
PROTEUS
     Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
     Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
     Being destined to a drier death on shore.
     Exit SPEED
     I must go send some better messenger:
     I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
     Receiving them from such a worthless post.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house. ****
     Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
JULIA
     But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
     Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
LUCETTA
     Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
JULIA
     Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
     That every day with parle encounter me,
     In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
LUCETTA
     Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
     According to my shallow simple skill.
JULIA
     What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
LUCETTA
     As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
     But, were I you, he never should be mine.
JULIA
     What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
LUCETTA
     Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
JULIA
     What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
LUCETTA
     Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
JULIA
     How now! what means this passion at his name?
LUCETTA
     Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
     That I, unworthy body as I am,
     Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
JULIA
     Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
LUCETTA
     Then thus: of many good I think him best.
JULIA
     Your reason?
LUCETTA
     I have no other, but a woman's reason;
     I think him so because I think him so.
JULIA
     And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
LUCETTA
     Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
JULIA
     Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
LUCETTA
     Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
JULIA
     His little speaking shows his love but small.
LUCETTA
     Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
JULIA
     They do not love that do not show their love.
LUCETTA
     O, they love least that let men know their love.
JULIA
     I would I knew his mind.
LUCETTA
     Peruse this paper, madam.
JULIA
     'To Julia.' Say, from whom?
LUCETTA
     That the contents will show.
JULIA
     Say, say, who gave it thee?
LUCETTA
     Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
     He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
     Did in your name receive it: pardon the
     fault I pray.
JULIA
     Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
     Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
     To whisper and conspire against my youth?
     Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
     And you an officer fit for the place.
     Or else return no more into my sight.
LUCETTA
     To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
JULIA
     Will ye be gone?
LUCETTA
     That you may ruminate.
     Exit
JULIA
     And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
     It were a shame to call her back again
     And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
     What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
     And would not force the letter to my view!
     Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
     Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
     Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
     That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
     And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
     How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
     When willingly I would have had her here!
     How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
     When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
     My penance is to call Lucetta back
     And ask remission for my folly past.
     What ho! Lucetta!
     Re-enter LUCETTA
LUCETTA
     What would your ladyship?
JULIA
     Is't near dinner-time?
LUCETTA
     I would it were,
     That you might kill your stomach on your meat
     And not upon your maid.
JULIA
     What is't that you took up so gingerly?
LUCETTA
     Nothing.
JULIA
     Why didst thou stoop, then?
LUCETTA
     To take a paper up that I let fall.
JULIA
     And is that paper nothing?
LUCETTA
     Nothing concerning me.
JULIA
     Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
LUCETTA
     Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
     Unless it have a false interpeter.
JULIA
     Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
LUCETTA
     That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
     Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
JULIA
     As little by such toys as may be possible.
     Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
LUCETTA
     It is too heavy for so light a tune.
JULIA
     Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
LUCETTA
     Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
JULIA
     And why not you?
LUCETTA
     I cannot reach so high.
JULIA
     Let's see your song. How now, minion!
LUCETTA
     Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
     And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
JULIA
     You do not?
LUCETTA
     No, madam; it is too sharp.
JULIA
     You, minion, are too saucy.
LUCETTA
     Nay, now you are too flat
     And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
     There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
JULIA
     The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
LUCETTA
     Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
JULIA
     This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
     Here is a coil with protestation!
     Tears the letter
     Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
     You would be fingering them, to anger me.
LUCETTA
     She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
     To be so anger'd with another letter.
     Exit
JULIA
     Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
     O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
     Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
     And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
     I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
     Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
     As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
     I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
     Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
     And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
     Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
     Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
     And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
     But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
     Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
     Till I have found each letter in the letter,
     Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
     Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
     And throw it thence into the raging sea!
     Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
     'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
     To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
     And yet I will not, sith so prettily
     He couples it to his complaining names.
     Thus will I fold them one on another:
     Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
     Re-enter LUCETTA
LUCETTA
     Madam,
     Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
JULIA
     Well, let us go.
LUCETTA
     What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
JULIA
     If you respect them, best to take them up.
LUCETTA
     Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
     Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
JULIA
     I see you have a month's mind to them.
LUCETTA
     Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
     I see things too, although you judge I wink.
JULIA
     Come, come; will't please you go?
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house. ****
     Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
ANTONIO
     Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
     Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
PANTHINO
     'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
ANTONIO
     Why, what of him?
PANTHINO
     He wonder'd that your lordship
     Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
     While other men, of slender reputation,
     Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
     Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
     Some to discover islands far away;
     Some to the studious universities.
     For any or for all these exercises,
     He said that Proteus your son was meet,
     And did request me to importune you
     To let him spend his time no more at home,
     Which would be great impeachment to his age,
     In having known no travel in his youth.
ANTONIO
     Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
     Whereon this month I have been hammering.
     I have consider'd well his loss of time
     And how he cannot be a perfect man,
     Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
     Experience is by industry achieved
     And perfected by the swift course of time.
     Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
PANTHINO
     I think your lordship is not ignorant
     How his companion, youthful Valentine,
     Attends the emperor in his royal court.
ANTONIO
     I know it well.
PANTHINO
     'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
     There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
     Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
     And be in eye of every exercise
     Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
ANTONIO
     I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
     And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
     The execution of it shall make known.
     Even with the speediest expedition
     I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
PANTHINO
     To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
     With other gentlemen of good esteem,
     Are journeying to salute the emperor
     And to commend their service to his will.
ANTONIO
     Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
     And, in good time! now will we break with him.
     Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS
     Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
     Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
     Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
     O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
     To seal our happiness with their consents!
     O heavenly Julia!
ANTONIO
     How now! what letter are you reading there?
PROTEUS
     May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
     Of commendations sent from Valentine,
     Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
ANTONIO
     Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
PROTEUS
     There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
     How happily he lives, how well beloved
     And daily graced by the emperor;
     Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
ANTONIO
     And how stand you affected to his wish?
PROTEUS
     As one relying on your lordship's will
     And not depending on his friendly wish.
ANTONIO
     My will is something sorted with his wish.
     Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
     For what I will, I will, and there an end.
     I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
     With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
     What maintenance he from his friends receives,
     Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
     To-morrow be in readiness to go:
     Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
PROTEUS
     My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
     Please you, deliberate a day or two.
ANTONIO
     Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
     No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
     Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
     To hasten on his expedition.
     Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO
PROTEUS
     Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
     And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
     I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
     Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
     And with the vantage of mine own excuse
     Hath he excepted most against my love.
     O, how this spring of love resembleth
     The uncertain glory of an April day,
     Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
     And by and by a cloud takes all away!
     Re-enter PANTHINO
PANTHINO
     Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
     He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.
PROTEUS
     Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
     And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace. ****
     Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
SPEED
     Sir, your glove.
VALENTINE
     Not mine; my gloves are on.
SPEED
     Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
VALENTINE
     Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
     Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
     Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
SPEED
     Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
VALENTINE
     How now, sirrah?
SPEED
     She is not within hearing, sir.
VALENTINE
     Why, sir, who bade you call her?
SPEED
     Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
VALENTINE
     Well, you'll still be too forward.
SPEED
     And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
VALENTINE
     Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
SPEED
     She that your worship loves?
VALENTINE
     Why, how know you that I am in love?
SPEED
     Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
     learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
     like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
     robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
     the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
     lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
     buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
     diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
     speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
     wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
     walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
     fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
     looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
     are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
     on you, I can hardly think you my master.
VALENTINE
     Are all these things perceived in me?
SPEED
     They are all perceived without ye.
VALENTINE
     Without me? they cannot.
SPEED
     Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
     were so simple, none else would: but you are so
     without these follies, that these follies are within
     you and shine through you like the water in an
     urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
     physician to comment on your malady.
VALENTINE
     But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
SPEED
     She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
VALENTINE
     Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
SPEED
     Why, sir, I know her not.
VALENTINE
     Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
     knowest her not?
SPEED
     Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
VALENTINE
     Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
SPEED
     Sir, I know that well enough.
VALENTINE
     What dost thou know?
SPEED
     That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
VALENTINE
     I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
SPEED
     That's because the one is painted and the other out
     of all count.
VALENTINE
     How painted? and how out of count?
SPEED
     Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
     man counts of her beauty.
VALENTINE
     How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
SPEED
     You never saw her since she was deformed.
VALENTINE
     How long hath she been deformed?
SPEED
     Ever since you loved her.
VALENTINE
     I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
     see her beautiful.
SPEED
     If you love her, you cannot see her.
VALENTINE
     Why?
SPEED
     Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
     or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
     have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
     ungartered!
VALENTINE
     What should I see then?
SPEED
     Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
     for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
     hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
VALENTINE
     Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
     morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
SPEED
     True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
     you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
     bolder to chide you for yours.
VALENTINE
     In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
SPEED
     I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
VALENTINE
     Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
     one she loves.
SPEED
     And have you?
VALENTINE
     I have.
SPEED
     Are they not lamely writ?
VALENTINE
     No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
     here she comes.
SPEED
     [Aside] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
     Now will he interpret to her.
     Enter SILVIA
VALENTINE
     Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
SPEED
     [Aside] O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.
SILVIA
     Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
SPEED
     [Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.
VALENTINE
     As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
     Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
     Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
     But for my duty to your ladyship.
SILVIA
     I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
VALENTINE
     Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
     For being ignorant to whom it goes
     I writ at random, very doubtfully.
SILVIA
     Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
VALENTINE
     No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
     Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--
SILVIA
     A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
     And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
     And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
     Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
SPEED
     [Aside] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
VALENTINE
     What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
SILVIA
     Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
     But since unwillingly, take them again.
     Nay, take them.
VALENTINE
     Madam, they are for you.
SILVIA
     Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
     But I will none of them; they are for you;
     I would have had them writ more movingly.
VALENTINE
     Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
SILVIA
     And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
     And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
VALENTINE
     If it please me, madam, what then?
SILVIA
     Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
     And so, good morrow, servant.
     Exit
SPEED
     O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
     As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
     My master sues to her, and she hath
     taught her suitor,
     He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
     O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
     That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
     the letter?
VALENTINE
     How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
SPEED
     Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
VALENTINE
     To do what?
SPEED
     To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
VALENTINE
     To whom?
SPEED
     To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
VALENTINE
     What figure?
SPEED
     By a letter, I should say.
VALENTINE
     Why, she hath not writ to me?
SPEED
     What need she, when she hath made you write to
     yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
VALENTINE
     No, believe me.
SPEED
     No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
     her earnest?
VALENTINE
     She gave me none, except an angry word.
SPEED
     Why, she hath given you a letter.
VALENTINE
     That's the letter I writ to her friend.
SPEED
     And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
VALENTINE
     I would it were no worse.
SPEED
     I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
     For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
     Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
     Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
     Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
     All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
     Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
VALENTINE
     I have dined.
SPEED
     Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
     feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
     victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
     your mistress; be moved, be moved.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house. ****
     Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
PROTEUS
     Have patience, gentle Julia.
JULIA
     I must, where is no remedy.
PROTEUS
     When possibly I can, I will return.
JULIA
     If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
     Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
     Giving a ring
PROTEUS
     Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
JULIA
     And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
PROTEUS
     Here is my hand for my true constancy;
     And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
     Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
     The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
     Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
     My father stays my coming; answer not;
     The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
     That tide will stay me longer than I should.
     Julia, farewell!
     Exit JULIA
     What, gone without a word?
     Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
     For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
     Enter PANTHINO
PANTHINO
     Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
PROTEUS
     Go; I come, I come.
     Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The same. A street. ****
     Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog
LAUNCE
     Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
     all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
     have received my proportion, like the prodigious
     son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
     court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
     dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
     wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
     wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
     perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
     one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
     has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
     wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
     having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
     parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
     shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
     no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
     cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
     hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
     it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
     on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
     sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
     as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
     am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
     dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
     so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
     now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
     now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
     come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
     like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
     'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
     come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
     the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
     word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
     Enter PANTHINO
PANTHINO
     Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
     and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
     matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
     lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
LAUNCE
     It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
     unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
PANTHINO
     What's the unkindest tide?
LAUNCE
     Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
PANTHINO
     Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
     losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
     thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
     master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
     service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?
LAUNCE
     For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
PANTHINO
     Where should I lose my tongue?
LAUNCE
     In thy tale.
PANTHINO
     In thy tail!
LAUNCE
     Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
     the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
     were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
     wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
PANTHINO
     Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
LAUNCE
     Sir, call me what thou darest.
PANTHINO
     Wilt thou go?
LAUNCE
     Well, I will go.

**** SCENE IV. Milan. The DUKE's palace. ****
     Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED
SILVIA
     Servant!
VALENTINE
     Mistress?
SPEED
     Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
VALENTINE
     Ay, boy, it's for love.
SPEED
     Not of you.
VALENTINE
     Of my mistress, then.
SPEED
     'Twere good you knocked him.
     Exit
SILVIA
     Servant, you are sad.
VALENTINE
     Indeed, madam, I seem so.
THURIO
     Seem you that you are not?
VALENTINE
     Haply I do.
THURIO
     So do counterfeits.
VALENTINE
     So do you.
THURIO
     What seem I that I am not?
VALENTINE
     Wise.
THURIO
     What instance of the contrary?
VALENTINE
     Your folly.
THURIO
     And how quote you my folly?
VALENTINE
     I quote it in your jerkin.
THURIO
     My jerkin is a doublet.
VALENTINE
     Well, then, I'll double your folly.
THURIO
     How?
SILVIA
     What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?
VALENTINE
     Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
THURIO
     That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
     in your air.
VALENTINE
     You have said, sir.
THURIO
     Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
VALENTINE
     I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
SILVIA
     A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
VALENTINE
     'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
SILVIA
     Who is that, servant?
VALENTINE
     Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
     Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,
     and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
THURIO
     Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
     make your wit bankrupt.
VALENTINE
     I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
     and, I think, no other treasure to give your
     followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
     that they live by your bare words.
SILVIA
     No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.
     Enter DUKE
DUKE
     Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
     Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
     What say you to a letter from your friends
     Of much good news?
VALENTINE
     My lord, I will be thankful.
     To any happy messenger from thence.
DUKE
     Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
VALENTINE
     Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
     To be of worth and worthy estimation
     And not without desert so well reputed.
DUKE
     Hath he not a son?
VALENTINE
     Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
     The honour and regard of such a father.
DUKE
     You know him well?
VALENTINE
     I know him as myself; for from our infancy
     We have conversed and spent our hours together:
     And though myself have been an idle truant,
     Omitting the sweet benefit of time
     To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
     Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
     Made use and fair advantage of his days;
     His years but young, but his experience old;
     His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
     And, in a word, for far behind his worth
     Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
     He is complete in feature and in mind
     With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
DUKE
     Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
     He is as worthy for an empress' love
     As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
     Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
     With commendation from great potentates;
     And here he means to spend his time awhile:
     I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
VALENTINE
     Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
DUKE
     Welcome him then according to his worth.
     Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
     For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
     I will send him hither to you presently.
     Exit
VALENTINE
     This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
     Had come along with me, but that his mistress
     Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
SILVIA
     Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
     Upon some other pawn for fealty.
VALENTINE
     Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
SILVIA
     Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
     How could he see his way to seek out you?
VALENTINE
     Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
THURIO
     They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
VALENTINE
     To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
     Upon a homely object Love can wink.
SILVIA
     Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
     Exit THURIO
     Enter PROTEUS
VALENTINE
     Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
     Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
SILVIA
     His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
     If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
VALENTINE
     Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
     To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
SILVIA
     Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
PROTEUS
     Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
     To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
VALENTINE
     Leave off discourse of disability:
     Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
PROTEUS
     My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
SILVIA
     And duty never yet did want his meed:
     Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
PROTEUS
     I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
SILVIA
     That you are welcome?
PROTEUS
     That you are worthless.
     Re-enter THURIO
THURIO
     Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
SILVIA
     I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
     Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
     I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
     When you have done, we look to hear from you.
PROTEUS
     We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
     Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
VALENTINE
     Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
PROTEUS
     Your friends are well and have them much commended.
VALENTINE
     And how do yours?
PROTEUS
     I left them all in health.
VALENTINE
     How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
PROTEUS
     My tales of love were wont to weary you;
     I know you joy not in a love discourse.
VALENTINE
     Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
     I have done penance for contemning Love,
     Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
     With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
     With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
     For in revenge of my contempt of love,
     Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
     And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
     O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
     And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
     There is no woe to his correction,
     Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
     Now no discourse, except it be of love;
     Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
     Upon the very naked name of love.
PROTEUS
     Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
     Was this the idol that you worship so?
VALENTINE
     Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
PROTEUS
     No; but she is an earthly paragon.
VALENTINE
     Call her divine.
PROTEUS
     I will not flatter her.
VALENTINE
     O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
PROTEUS
     When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
     And I must minister the like to you.
VALENTINE
     Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
     Yet let her be a principality,
     Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
PROTEUS
     Except my mistress.
VALENTINE
     Sweet, except not any;
     Except thou wilt except against my love.
PROTEUS
     Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
VALENTINE
     And I will help thee to prefer her too:
     She shall be dignified with this high honour--
     To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
     Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
     And, of so great a favour growing proud,
     Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
     And make rough winter everlastingly.
PROTEUS
     Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
VALENTINE
     Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
     To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
     She is alone.
PROTEUS
     Then let her alone.
VALENTINE
     Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
     And I as rich in having such a jewel
     As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
     The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
     Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
     Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
     My foolish rival, that her father likes
     Only for his possessions are so huge,
     Is gone with her along, and I must after,
     For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
PROTEUS
     But she loves you?
VALENTINE
     Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
     marriage-hour,
     With all the cunning manner of our flight,
     Determined of; how I must climb her window,
     The ladder made of cords, and all the means
     Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
     Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
     In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
PROTEUS
     Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
     I must unto the road, to disembark
     Some necessaries that I needs must use,
     And then I'll presently attend you.
VALENTINE
     Will you make haste?
PROTEUS
     I will.
     Exit VALENTINE
     Even as one heat another heat expels,
     Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
     So the remembrance of my former love
     Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
     Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
     Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
     That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
     She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
     That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
     Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
     Bears no impression of the thing it was.
     Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
     And that I love him not as I was wont.
     O, but I love his lady too too much,
     And that's the reason I love him so little.
     How shall I dote on her with more advice,
     That thus without advice begin to love her!
     'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
     And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
     But when I look on her perfections,
     There is no reason but I shall be blind.
     If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
     If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
     Exit
**** SCENE V. The same. A street. ****
     Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
SPEED
     Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!
LAUNCE
     Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
     welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
     undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
     place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
     say 'Welcome!'
SPEED
     Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you
     presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou
     shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how
     did thy master part with Madam Julia?
LAUNCE
     Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
     fairly in jest.
SPEED
     But shall she marry him?
LAUNCE
     No.
SPEED
     How then? shall he marry her?
LAUNCE
     No, neither.
SPEED
     What, are they broken?
LAUNCE
     No, they are both as whole as a fish.
SPEED
     Why, then, how stands the matter with them?
LAUNCE
     Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
     stands well with her.
SPEED
     What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
LAUNCE
     What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My
     staff understands me.
SPEED
     What thou sayest?
LAUNCE
     Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,
     and my staff understands me.
SPEED
     It stands under thee, indeed.
LAUNCE
     Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
SPEED
     But tell me true, will't be a match?
LAUNCE
     Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
     it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
SPEED
     The conclusion is then that it will.
LAUNCE
     Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
SPEED
     'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
     thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
LAUNCE
     I never knew him otherwise.
SPEED
     Than how?
LAUNCE
     A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
SPEED
     Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
LAUNCE
     Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
SPEED
     I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
LAUNCE
     Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
     in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
     if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
     name of a Christian.
SPEED
     Why?
LAUNCE
     Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
     go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
SPEED
     At thy service.

**** SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace. ****
     Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS
     To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
     To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
     To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
     And even that power which gave me first my oath
     Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
     Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
     O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
     Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
     At first I did adore a twinkling star,
     But now I worship a celestial sun.
     Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
     And he wants wit that wants resolved will
     To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
     Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
     Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
     With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
     I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
     But there I leave to love where I should love.
     Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
     If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
     If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
     For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
     I to myself am dearer than a friend,
     For love is still most precious in itself;
     And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
     Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
     I will forget that Julia is alive,
     Remembering that my love to her is dead;
     And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
     Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
     I cannot now prove constant to myself,
     Without some treachery used to Valentine.
     This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
     To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
     Myself in counsel, his competitor.
     Now presently I'll give her father notice
     Of their disguising and pretended flight;
     Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
     For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
     But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
     By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
     Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
     As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
     Exit
**** SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house. ****
     Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
JULIA
     Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
     And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
     Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
     Are visibly character'd and engraved,
     To lesson me and tell me some good mean
     How, with my honour, I may undertake
     A journey to my loving Proteus.
LUCETTA
     Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
JULIA
     A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
     To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
     Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
     And when the flight is made to one so dear,
     Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
LUCETTA
     Better forbear till Proteus make return.
JULIA
     O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
     Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
     By longing for that food so long a time.
     Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
     Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
     As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
LUCETTA
     I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
     But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
     Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
JULIA
     The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
     The current that with gentle murmur glides,
     Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
     But when his fair course is not hindered,
     He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
     Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
     He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
     And so by many winding nooks he strays
     With willing sport to the wild ocean.
     Then let me go and hinder not my course
     I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
     And make a pastime of each weary step,
     Till the last step have brought me to my love;
     And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
     A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
LUCETTA
     But in what habit will you go along?
JULIA
     Not like a woman; for I would prevent
     The loose encounters of lascivious men:
     Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
     As may beseem some well-reputed page.
LUCETTA
     Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
JULIA
     No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
     With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
     To be fantastic may become a youth
     Of greater time than I shall show to be.
LUCETTA
     What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
JULIA
     That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
     What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
     Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
LUCETTA
     You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
JULIA
     Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.
LUCETTA
     A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
     Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
JULIA
     Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
     What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
     But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
     For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
     I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
LUCETTA
     If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
JULIA
     Nay, that I will not.
LUCETTA
     Then never dream on infamy, but go.
     If Proteus like your journey when you come,
     No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
     I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
JULIA
     That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
     A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
     And instances of infinite of love
     Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
LUCETTA
     All these are servants to deceitful men.
JULIA
     Base men, that use them to so base effect!
     But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
     His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
     His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
     His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
     His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
LUCETTA
     Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
JULIA
     Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
     To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
     Only deserve my love by loving him;
     And presently go with me to my chamber,
     To take a note of what I stand in need of,
     To furnish me upon my longing journey.
     All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
     My goods, my lands, my reputation;
     Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
     Come, answer not, but to it presently!
     I am impatient of my tarriance.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace. ****
     Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS
DUKE
     Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
     We have some secrets to confer about.
     Exit THURIO
     Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
PROTEUS
     My gracious lord, that which I would discover
     The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
     But when I call to mind your gracious favours
     Done to me, undeserving as I am,
     My duty pricks me on to utter that
     Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
     Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
     This night intends to steal away your daughter:
     Myself am one made privy to the plot.
     I know you have determined to bestow her
     On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
     And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
     It would be much vexation to your age.
     Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
     To cross my friend in his intended drift
     Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
     A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
     Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
DUKE
     Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
     Which to requite, command me while I live.
     This love of theirs myself have often seen,
     Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
     And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
     Sir Valentine her company and my court:
     But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
     And so unworthily disgrace the man,
     A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
     I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
     That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
     And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
     Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
     I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
     The key whereof myself have ever kept;
     And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
PROTEUS
     Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
     How he her chamber-window will ascend
     And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
     For which the youthful lover now is gone
     And this way comes he with it presently;
     Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
     But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
     That my discovery be not aimed at;
     For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
     Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
DUKE
     Upon mine honour, he shall never know
     That I had any light from thee of this.
PROTEUS
     Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.
     Exit
     Enter VALENTINE
DUKE
     Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
VALENTINE
     Please it your grace, there is a messenger
     That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
     And I am going to deliver them.
DUKE
     Be they of much import?
VALENTINE
     The tenor of them doth but signify
     My health and happy being at your court.
DUKE
     Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
     I am to break with thee of some affairs
     That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
     'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
     To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
VALENTINE
     I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
     Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
     Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
     Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
     Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
DUKE
     No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
     Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
     Neither regarding that she is my child
     Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
     And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
     Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
     And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
     Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
     I now am full resolved to take a wife
     And turn her out to who will take her in:
     Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
     For me and my possessions she esteems not.
VALENTINE
     What would your Grace have me to do in this?
DUKE
     There is a lady in Verona here
     Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
     And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
     Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
     For long agone I have forgot to court;
     Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
     How and which way I may bestow myself
     To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
VALENTINE
     Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
     Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
     More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
DUKE
     But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
VALENTINE
     A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
     Send her another; never give her o'er;
     For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
     If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
     But rather to beget more love in you:
     If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
     For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
     Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
     For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
     Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
     Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
     That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
     If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
DUKE
     But she I mean is promised by her friends
     Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
     And kept severely from resort of men,
     That no man hath access by day to her.
VALENTINE
     Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
DUKE
     Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
     That no man hath recourse to her by night.
VALENTINE
     What lets but one may enter at her window?
DUKE
     Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
     And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
     Without apparent hazard of his life.
VALENTINE
     Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
     To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
     Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
     So bold Leander would adventure it.
DUKE
     Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
     Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
VALENTINE
     When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
DUKE
     This very night; for Love is like a child,
     That longs for every thing that he can come by.
VALENTINE
     By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
DUKE
     But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
     How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
VALENTINE
     It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
     Under a cloak that is of any length.
DUKE
     A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
VALENTINE
     Ay, my good lord.
DUKE
     Then let me see thy cloak:
     I'll get me one of such another length.
VALENTINE
     Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
DUKE
     How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
     I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
     What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
     And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
     I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
     Reads
     'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
     And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
     O, could their master come and go as lightly,
     Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
     My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
     While I, their king, that hither them importune,
     Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
     Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
     I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
     That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
     What's here?
     'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
     'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
     Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
     Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
     And with thy daring folly burn the world?
     Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
     Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
     Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
     And think my patience, more than thy desert,
     Is privilege for thy departure hence:
     Thank me for this more than for all the favours
     Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
     But if thou linger in my territories
     Longer than swiftest expedition
     Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
     By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
     I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
     Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
     But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
     Exit
VALENTINE
     And why not death rather than living torment?
     To die is to be banish'd from myself;
     And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
     Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
     What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
     What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
     Unless it be to think that she is by
     And feed upon the shadow of perfection
     Except I be by Silvia in the night,
     There is no music in the nightingale;
     Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
     There is no day for me to look upon;
     She is my essence, and I leave to be,
     If I be not by her fair influence
     Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
     I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
     Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
     But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
     Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
PROTEUS
     Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
LAUNCE
     Soho, soho!
PROTEUS
     What seest thou?
LAUNCE
     Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
     but 'tis a Valentine.
PROTEUS
     Valentine?
VALENTINE
     No.
PROTEUS
     Who then? his spirit?
VALENTINE
     Neither.
PROTEUS
     What then?
VALENTINE
     Nothing.
LAUNCE
     Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
PROTEUS
     Who wouldst thou strike?
LAUNCE
     Nothing.
PROTEUS
     Villain, forbear.
LAUNCE
     Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--
PROTEUS
     Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
VALENTINE
     My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
     So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
PROTEUS
     Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
     For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
VALENTINE
     Is Silvia dead?
PROTEUS
     No, Valentine.
VALENTINE
     No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
     Hath she forsworn me?
PROTEUS
     No, Valentine.
VALENTINE
     No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
     What is your news?
LAUNCE
     Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
PROTEUS
     That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
     From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
VALENTINE
     O, I have fed upon this woe already,
     And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
     Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
PROTEUS
     Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--
     Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
     A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
     Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
     With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
     Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
     As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
     But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
     Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
     Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
     But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
     Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
     When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
     That to close prison he commanded her,
     With many bitter threats of biding there.
VALENTINE
     No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
     Have some malignant power upon my life:
     If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
     As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
PROTEUS
     Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
     And study help for that which thou lament'st.
     Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
     Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
     Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
     Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
     And manage it against despairing thoughts.
     Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
     Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
     Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
     The time now serves not to expostulate:
     Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;
     And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
     Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
     As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
     Regard thy danger, and along with me!
VALENTINE
     I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
     Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
PROTEUS
     Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
VALENTINE
     O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
     Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
LAUNCE
     I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to
     think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
     all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
     that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
     team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
     'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
     will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
     'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis
     a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for
     wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
     which is much in a bare Christian.
     Pulling out a paper
     Here is the cate-log of her condition.
     'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
     can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
     carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
     She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
     with clean hands.
     Enter SPEED
SPEED
     How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
     mastership?
LAUNCE
     With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.
SPEED
     Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What
     news, then, in your paper?
LAUNCE
     The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
SPEED
     Why, man, how black?
LAUNCE
     Why, as black as ink.
SPEED
     Let me read them.
LAUNCE
     Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.
SPEED
     Thou liest; I can.
LAUNCE
     I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
SPEED
     Marry, the son of my grandfather.
LAUNCE
     O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
     grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
SPEED
     Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
LAUNCE
     There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!
SPEED
     [Reads] 'Imprimis: She can milk.'
LAUNCE
     Ay, that she can.
SPEED
     'Item: She brews good ale.'
LAUNCE
     And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
     heart, you brew good ale.'
SPEED
     'Item: She can sew.'
LAUNCE
     That's as much as to say, Can she so?
SPEED
     'Item: She can knit.'
LAUNCE
     What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when
     she can knit him a stock?
SPEED
     'Item: She can wash and scour.'
LAUNCE
     A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
     and scoured.
SPEED
     'Item: She can spin.'
LAUNCE
     Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
     spin for her living.
SPEED
     'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
LAUNCE
     That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that,
     indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.
SPEED
     'Here follow her vices.'
LAUNCE
     Close at the heels of her virtues.
SPEED
     'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
     of her breath.'
LAUNCE
     Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.
SPEED
     'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
LAUNCE
     That makes amends for her sour breath.
SPEED
     'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
LAUNCE
     It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
SPEED
     'Item: She is slow in words.'
LAUNCE
     O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
     be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
     thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.
SPEED
     'Item: She is proud.'
LAUNCE
     Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
     be ta'en from her.
SPEED
     'Item: She hath no teeth.'
LAUNCE
     I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
SPEED
     'Item: She is curst.'
LAUNCE
     Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
SPEED
     'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
LAUNCE
     If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
     will; for good things should be praised.
SPEED
     'Item: She is too liberal.'
LAUNCE
     Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
     is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
     I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
     that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
SPEED
     'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
     than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE
     Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not
     mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
     Rehearse that once more.
SPEED
     'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--
LAUNCE
     More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The
     cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
     is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
     is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
     less. What's next?
SPEED
     'And more faults than hairs,'--
LAUNCE
     That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
SPEED
     'And more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE
     Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
     I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
     impossible,--
SPEED
     What then?
LAUNCE
     Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
     for thee at the North-gate.
SPEED
     For me?
LAUNCE
     For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
     better man than thee.
SPEED
     And must I go to him?
LAUNCE
     Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
     that going will scarce serve the turn.
SPEED
     Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
     Exit
LAUNCE
     Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
     unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
     secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace. ****
     Enter DUKE and THURIO
DUKE
     Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
     Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
THURIO
     Since his exile she hath despised me most,
     Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
     That I am desperate of obtaining her.
DUKE
     This weak impress of love is as a figure
     Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
     Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
     A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
     And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
     Enter PROTEUS
     How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
     According to our proclamation gone?
PROTEUS
     Gone, my good lord.
DUKE
     My daughter takes his going grievously.
PROTEUS
     A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
DUKE
     So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
     Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
     For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
     Makes me the better to confer with thee.
PROTEUS
     Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
     Let me not live to look upon your grace.
DUKE
     Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
     The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
PROTEUS
     I do, my lord.
DUKE
     And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
     How she opposes her against my will
PROTEUS
     She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
DUKE
     Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
     What might we do to make the girl forget
     The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
PROTEUS
     The best way is to slander Valentine
     With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
     Three things that women highly hold in hate.
DUKE
     Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
PROTEUS
     Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
     Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
     By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
DUKE
     Then you must undertake to slander him.
PROTEUS
     And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
     'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
     Especially against his very friend.
DUKE
     Where your good word cannot advantage him,
     Your slander never can endamage him;
     Therefore the office is indifferent,
     Being entreated to it by your friend.
PROTEUS
     You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
     By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
     She shall not long continue love to him.
     But say this weed her love from Valentine,
     It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
THURIO
     Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
     Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
     You must provide to bottom it on me;
     Which must be done by praising me as much
     As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
DUKE
     And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
     Because we know, on Valentine's report,
     You are already Love's firm votary
     And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
     Upon this warrant shall you have access
     Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
     For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
     And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
     Where you may temper her by your persuasion
     To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
PROTEUS
     As much as I can do, I will effect:
     But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
     You must lay lime to tangle her desires
     By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
     Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
DUKE
     Ay,
     Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
PROTEUS
     Say that upon the altar of her beauty
     You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
     Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
     Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
     That may discover such integrity:
     For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
     Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
     Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
     Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
     After your dire-lamenting elegies,
     Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
     With some sweet concert; to their instruments
     Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
     Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
     This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
DUKE
     This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
THURIO
     And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
     Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
     Let us into the city presently
     To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
     I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
     To give the onset to thy good advice.
DUKE
     About it, gentlemen!
PROTEUS
     We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
     And afterward determine our proceedings.
DUKE
     Even now about it! I will pardon you.
     Exeunt
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest. ****
     Enter certain Outlaws
First Outlaw
     Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
Second Outlaw
     If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
     Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Third Outlaw
     Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
     If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
SPEED
     Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
     That all the travellers do fear so much.
VALENTINE
     My friends,--
First Outlaw
     That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
Second Outlaw
     Peace! we'll hear him.
Third Outlaw
     Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
VALENTINE
     Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
     A man I am cross'd with adversity;
     My riches are these poor habiliments,
     Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
     You take the sum and substance that I have.
Second Outlaw
     Whither travel you?
VALENTINE
     To Verona.
First Outlaw
     Whence came you?
VALENTINE
     From Milan.
Third Outlaw
     Have you long sojourned there?
VALENTINE
     Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
     If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
First Outlaw
     What, were you banish'd thence?
VALENTINE
     I was.
Second Outlaw
     For what offence?
VALENTINE
     For that which now torments me to rehearse:
     I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
     Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,
     Without false vantage or base treachery.
First Outlaw
     Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
     But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
VALENTINE
     I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
Second Outlaw
     Have you the tongues?
VALENTINE
     My youthful travel therein made me happy,
     Or else I often had been miserable.
Third Outlaw
     By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
     This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
First Outlaw
     We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
SPEED
     Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
VALENTINE
     Peace, villain!
Second Outlaw
     Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
VALENTINE
     Nothing but my fortune.
Third Outlaw
     Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
     Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
     Thrust from the company of awful men:
     Myself was from Verona banished
     For practising to steal away a lady,
     An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
Second Outlaw
     And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
     Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
First Outlaw
     And I for such like petty crimes as these,
     But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
     That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
     And partly, seeing you are beautified
     With goodly shape and by your own report
     A linguist and a man of such perfection
     As we do in our quality much want--
Second Outlaw
     Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
     Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
     Are you content to be our general?
     To make a virtue of necessity
     And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
Third Outlaw
     What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
     Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
     We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
     Love thee as our commander and our king.
First Outlaw
     But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
Second Outlaw
     Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
VALENTINE
     I take your offer and will live with you,
     Provided that you do no outrages
     On silly women or poor passengers.
Third Outlaw
     No, we detest such vile base practises.
     Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
     And show thee all the treasure we have got,
     Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

**** SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber. ****
     Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS
     Already have I been false to Valentine
     And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
     Under the colour of commending him,
     I have access my own love to prefer:
     But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
     To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
     When I protest true loyalty to her,
     She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
     When to her beauty I commend my vows,
     She bids me think how I have been forsworn
     In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
     And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
     The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
     Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
     The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
     But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
     And give some evening music to her ear.
     Enter THURIO and Musicians
THURIO
     How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
PROTEUS
     Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
     Will creep in service where it cannot go.
THURIO
     Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
PROTEUS
     Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
THURIO
     Who? Silvia?
PROTEUS
     Ay, Silvia; for your sake.
THURIO
     I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
     Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
     Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes
Host
     Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
     pray you, why is it?
JULIA
     Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
Host
     Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
     you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
JULIA
     But shall I hear him speak?
Host
     Ay, that you shall.
JULIA
     That will be music.
     Music plays
Host
     Hark, hark!
JULIA
     Is he among these?
Host
     Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
     SONG.
     Who is Silvia? what is she,
     That all our swains commend her?
     Holy, fair and wise is she;
     The heaven such grace did lend her,
     That she might admired be.
     Is she kind as she is fair?
     For beauty lives with kindness.
     Love doth to her eyes repair,
     To help him of his blindness,
     And, being help'd, inhabits there.
     Then to Silvia let us sing,
     That Silvia is excelling;
     She excels each mortal thing
     Upon the dull earth dwelling:
     To her let us garlands bring.
Host
     How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
     do you, man? the music likes you not.
JULIA
     You mistake; the musician likes me not.
Host
     Why, my pretty youth?
JULIA
     He plays false, father.
Host
     How? out of tune on the strings?
JULIA
     Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
     heart-strings.
Host
     You have a quick ear.
JULIA
     Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
Host
     I perceive you delight not in music.
JULIA
     Not a whit, when it jars so.
Host
     Hark, what fine change is in the music!
JULIA
     Ay, that change is the spite.
Host
     You would have them always play but one thing?
JULIA
     I would always have one play but one thing.
     But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
     Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
Host
     I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
     her out of all nick.
JULIA
     Where is Launce?
Host
     Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
     master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
JULIA
     Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
PROTEUS
     Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
     That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
THURIO
     Where meet we?
PROTEUS
     At Saint Gregory's well.
THURIO
     Farewell.
     Exeunt THURIO and Musicians
     Enter SILVIA above
PROTEUS
     Madam, good even to your ladyship.
SILVIA
     I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
     Who is that that spake?
PROTEUS
     One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
     You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
SILVIA
     Sir Proteus, as I take it.
PROTEUS
     Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
SILVIA
     What's your will?
PROTEUS
     That I may compass yours.
SILVIA
     You have your wish; my will is even this:
     That presently you hie you home to bed.
     Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
     Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
     To be seduced by thy flattery,
     That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
     Return, return, and make thy love amends.
     For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
     I am so far from granting thy request
     That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
     And by and by intend to chide myself
     Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
PROTEUS
     I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
     But she is dead.
JULIA
     [Aside] 'Twere false, if I should speak it;
     For I am sure she is not buried.
SILVIA
     Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
     Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
     I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
     To wrong him with thy importunacy?
PROTEUS
     I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
SILVIA
     And so suppose am I; for in his grave
     Assure thyself my love is buried.
PROTEUS
     Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
SILVIA
     Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
     Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
JULIA
     [Aside] He heard not that.
PROTEUS
     Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
     Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
     The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
     To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
     For since the substance of your perfect self
     Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
     And to your shadow will I make true love.
JULIA
     [Aside] If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
     deceive it,
     And make it but a shadow, as I am.
SILVIA
     I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
     But since your falsehood shall become you well
     To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
     Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
     And so, good rest.
PROTEUS
     As wretches have o'ernight
     That wait for execution in the morn.
     Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally
JULIA
     Host, will you go?
Host
     By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
JULIA
     Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
Host
     Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
     day.
JULIA
     Not so; but it hath been the longest night
     That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. The same. ****
     Enter EGLAMOUR
EGLAMOUR
     This is the hour that Madam Silvia
     Entreated me to call and know her mind:
     There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
     Madam, madam!
     Enter SILVIA above
SILVIA
     Who calls?
EGLAMOUR
     Your servant and your friend;
     One that attends your ladyship's command.
SILVIA
     Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
EGLAMOUR
     As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
     According to your ladyship's impose,
     I am thus early come to know what service
     It is your pleasure to command me in.
SILVIA
     O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
     Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
     Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:
     Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
     I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
     Nor how my father would enforce me marry
     Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
     Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
     No grief did ever come so near thy heart
     As when thy lady and thy true love died,
     Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
     Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
     To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
     And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
     I do desire thy worthy company,
     Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
     Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
     But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
     And on the justice of my flying hence,
     To keep me from a most unholy match,
     Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
     I do desire thee, even from a heart
     As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
     To bear me company and go with me:
     If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
     That I may venture to depart alone.
EGLAMOUR
     Madam, I pity much your grievances;
     Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
     I give consent to go along with you,
     Recking as little what betideth me
     As much I wish all good befortune you.
     When will you go?
SILVIA
     This evening coming.
EGLAMOUR
     Where shall I meet you?
SILVIA
     At Friar Patrick's cell,
     Where I intend holy confession.
EGLAMOUR
     I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
SILVIA
     Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
     Exeunt severally
**** SCENE IV. The same. ****
     Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog
LAUNCE
     When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
     look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
     puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
     four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
     I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
     'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
     him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
     and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
     steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
     O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
     in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
     one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
     as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
     more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
     I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
     live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
     thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
     gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
     not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
     all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
     one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
     out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
     I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
     knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
     whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
     the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
     the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
     wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
     of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
     his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
     stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
     been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
     he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
     Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
     trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
     Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
     do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
     water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
     thou ever see me do such a trick?
     Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
PROTEUS
     Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
     And will employ thee in some service presently.
JULIA
     In what you please: I'll do what I can.
PROTEUS
     I hope thou wilt.
     To LAUNCE
     How now, you whoreson peasant!
     Where have you been these two days loitering?
LAUNCE
     Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
PROTEUS
     And what says she to my little jewel?
LAUNCE
     Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
     currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
PROTEUS
     But she received my dog?
LAUNCE
     No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
     back again.
PROTEUS
     What, didst thou offer her this from me?
LAUNCE
     Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
     the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
     offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
     yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
PROTEUS
     Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
     Or ne'er return again into my sight.
     Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
     Exit LAUNCE
     A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
     Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
     Partly that I have need of such a youth
     That can with some discretion do my business,
     For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
     But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
     Which, if my augury deceive me not,
     Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
     Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
     Go presently and take this ring with thee,
     Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
     She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
JULIA
     It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
     She is dead, belike?
PROTEUS
     Not so; I think she lives.
JULIA
     Alas!
PROTEUS
     Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
JULIA
     I cannot choose
     But pity her.
PROTEUS
     Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
JULIA
     Because methinks that she loved you as well
     As you do love your lady Silvia:
     She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
     You dote on her that cares not for your love.
     'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
     And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
PROTEUS
     Well, give her that ring and therewithal
     This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
     I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
     Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
     Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
     Exit
JULIA
     How many women would do such a message?
     Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
     A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
     Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
     That with his very heart despiseth me?
     Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
     Because I love him I must pity him.
     This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
     To bind him to remember my good will;
     And now am I, unhappy messenger,
     To plead for that which I would not obtain,
     To carry that which I would have refused,
     To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
     I am my master's true-confirmed love;
     But cannot be true servant to my master,
     Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
     Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
     As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
     Enter SILVIA, attended
     Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
     To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
SILVIA
     What would you with her, if that I be she?
JULIA
     If you be she, I do entreat your patience
     To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
SILVIA
     From whom?
JULIA
     From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
SILVIA
     O, he sends you for a picture.
JULIA
     Ay, madam.
SILVIA
     Ursula, bring my picture here.
     Go give your master this: tell him from me,
     One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
     Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
JULIA
     Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
     Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
     Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
     This is the letter to your ladyship.
SILVIA
     I pray thee, let me look on that again.
JULIA
     It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
SILVIA
     There, hold!
     I will not look upon your master's lines:
     I know they are stuff'd with protestations
     And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
     As easily as I do tear his paper.
JULIA
     Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
SILVIA
     The more shame for him that he sends it me;
     For I have heard him say a thousand times
     His Julia gave it him at his departure.
     Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
     Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
JULIA
     She thanks you.
SILVIA
     What say'st thou?
JULIA
     I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
     Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
SILVIA
     Dost thou know her?
JULIA
     Almost as well as I do know myself:
     To think upon her woes I do protest
     That I have wept a hundred several times.
SILVIA
     Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
JULIA
     I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
SILVIA
     Is she not passing fair?
JULIA
     She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
     When she did think my master loved her well,
     She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
     But since she did neglect her looking-glass
     And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
     The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
     And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
     That now she is become as black as I.
SILVIA
     How tall was she?
JULIA
     About my stature; for at Pentecost,
     When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
     Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
     And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
     Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
     As if the garment had been made for me:
     Therefore I know she is about my height.
     And at that time I made her weep agood,
     For I did play a lamentable part:
     Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
     For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
     Which I so lively acted with my tears
     That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
     Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
     If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
SILVIA
     She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
     Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
     I weep myself to think upon thy words.
     Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
     For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
     Farewell.
     Exit SILVIA, with attendants
JULIA
     And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
     A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
     I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
     Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
     Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
     Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
     If I had such a tire, this face of mine
     Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
     And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
     Unless I flatter with myself too much.
     Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
     If that be all the difference in his love,
     I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
     Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
     Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
     What should it be that he respects in her
     But I can make respective in myself,
     If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
     Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
     For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
     Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
     And, were there sense in his idolatry,
     My substance should be statue in thy stead.
     I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
     That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
     I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
     To make my master out of love with thee!

     Enter EGLAMOUR
EGLAMOUR
     The sun begins to gild the western sky;
     And now it is about the very hour
     That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
     She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
     Unless it be to come before their time;
     So much they spur their expedition.
     See where she comes.
     Enter SILVIA
     Lady, a happy evening!
SILVIA
     Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
     Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
     I fear I am attended by some spies.
EGLAMOUR
     Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
     If we recover that, we are sure enough.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace. ****
     Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA
THURIO
     Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
PROTEUS
     O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
     And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
THURIO
     What, that my leg is too long?
PROTEUS
     No; that it is too little.
THURIO
     I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
JULIA
     [Aside] But love will not be spurr'd to what
     it loathes.
THURIO
     What says she to my face?
PROTEUS
     She says it is a fair one.
THURIO
     Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
PROTEUS
     But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
     Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
JULIA
     [Aside] 'Tis true; such pearls as put out
     ladies' eyes;
     For I had rather wink than look on them.
THURIO
     How likes she my discourse?
PROTEUS
     Ill, when you talk of war.
THURIO
     But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
JULIA
     [Aside] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
THURIO
     What says she to my valour?
PROTEUS
     O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
JULIA
     [Aside] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
THURIO
     What says she to my birth?
PROTEUS
     That you are well derived.
JULIA
     [Aside] True; from a gentleman to a fool.
THURIO
     Considers she my possessions?
PROTEUS
     O, ay; and pities them.
THURIO
     Wherefore?
JULIA
     [Aside] That such an ass should owe them.
PROTEUS
     That they are out by lease.
JULIA
     Here comes the duke.
     Enter DUKE
DUKE
     How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
     Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
THURIO
     Not I.
PROTEUS
     Nor I.
DUKE
     Saw you my daughter?
PROTEUS
     Neither.
DUKE
     Why then,
     She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
     And Eglamour is in her company.
     'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
     As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
     Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
     But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
     Besides, she did intend confession
     At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
     These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
     Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
     But mount you presently and meet with me
     Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
     That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
     Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
     Exit
THURIO
     Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
     That flies her fortune when it follows her.
     I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
     Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
     Exit
PROTEUS
     And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
     Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
     Exit
JULIA
     And I will follow, more to cross that love
     Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.

First Outlaw
     Come, come,
     Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
SILVIA
     A thousand more mischances than this one
     Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
Second Outlaw
     Come, bring her away.
First Outlaw
     Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Third Outlaw
     Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
     But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
     Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
     There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
     The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
First Outlaw
     Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
     Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
     And will not use a woman lawlessly.
SILVIA
     O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Another part of the forest. ****
     Enter VALENTINE
VALENTINE
     How use doth breed a habit in a man!
     This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
     I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
     Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
     And to the nightingale's complaining notes
     Tune my distresses and record my woes.
     O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
     Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
     Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
     And leave no memory of what it was!
     Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
     Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
     What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
     These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
     Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
     They love me well; yet I have much to do
     To keep them from uncivil outrages.
     Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
     Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA
PROTEUS
     Madam, this service I have done for you,
     Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
     To hazard life and rescue you from him
     That would have forced your honour and your love;
     Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
     A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
     And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
VALENTINE
     [Aside] How like a dream is this I see and hear!
     Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
SILVIA
     O miserable, unhappy that I am!
PROTEUS
     Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
     But by my coming I have made you happy.
SILVIA
     By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
JULIA
     [Aside] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
SILVIA
     Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
     I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
     Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
     O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
     Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
     And full as much, for more there cannot be,
     I do detest false perjured Proteus.
     Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
PROTEUS
     What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
     Would I not undergo for one calm look!
     O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
     When women cannot love where they're beloved!
SILVIA
     When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
     Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
     For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
     Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
     Descended into perjury, to love me.
     Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
     And that's far worse than none; better have none
     Than plural faith which is too much by one:
     Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
PROTEUS
     In love
     Who respects friend?
SILVIA
     All men but Proteus.
PROTEUS
     Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
     Can no way change you to a milder form,
     I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
     And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
SILVIA
     O heaven!
PROTEUS
     I'll force thee yield to my desire.
VALENTINE
     Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
     Thou friend of an ill fashion!
PROTEUS
     Valentine!
VALENTINE
     Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
     For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
     Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
     Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
     I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
     Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
     Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
     I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
     But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
     The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
     'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
PROTEUS
     My shame and guilt confounds me.
     Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
     Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
     I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
     As e'er I did commit.
VALENTINE
     Then I am paid;
     And once again I do receive thee honest.
     Who by repentance is not satisfied
     Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
     By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
     And, that my love may appear plain and free,
     All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
JULIA
     O me unhappy!
     Swoons
PROTEUS
     Look to the boy.
VALENTINE
     Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
     Look up; speak.
JULIA
     O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
     to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
PROTEUS
     Where is that ring, boy?
JULIA
     Here 'tis; this is it.
PROTEUS
     How! let me see:
     Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
JULIA
     O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
     This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
PROTEUS
     But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
     I gave this unto Julia.
JULIA
     And Julia herself did give it me;
     And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
PROTEUS
     How! Julia!
JULIA
     Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
     And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
     How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
     O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
     Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
     Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
     In a disguise of love:
     It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
     Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
PROTEUS
     Than men their minds! 'tis true.
     O heaven! were man
     But constant, he were perfect. That one error
     Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
     Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
     What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
     More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
VALENTINE
     Come, come, a hand from either:
     Let me be blest to make this happy close;
     'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
PROTEUS
     Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
JULIA
     And I mine.
     Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO
Outlaws
     A prize, a prize, a prize!
VALENTINE
     Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
     Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
     Banished Valentine.
DUKE
     Sir Valentine!
THURIO
     Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
VALENTINE
     Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
     Come not within the measure of my wrath;
     Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
     Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
     Take but possession of her with a touch:
     I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
THURIO
     Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
     I hold him but a fool that will endanger
     His body for a girl that loves him not:
     I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
DUKE
     The more degenerate and base art thou,
     To make such means for her as thou hast done
     And leave her on such slight conditions.
     Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
     I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
     And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
     Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
     Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
     Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
     To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
     Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
     Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
VALENTINE
     I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
     I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
     To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
DUKE
     I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
VALENTINE
     These banish'd men that I have kept withal
     Are men endued with worthy qualities:
     Forgive them what they have committed here
     And let them be recall'd from their exile:
     They are reformed, civil, full of good
     And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
DUKE
     Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
     Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
     Come, let us go: we will include all jars
     With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
VALENTINE
     And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
     With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
     What think you of this page, my lord?
DUKE
     I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
VALENTINE
     I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
DUKE
     What mean you by that saying?
VALENTINE
     Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
     That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
     Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
     The story of your loves discovered:
     That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
     One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
     Exeunt

     Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND,
     SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others
KING HENRY IV
     So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
     Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
     And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
     To be commenced in strands afar remote.
     No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
     Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
     Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
     Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
     Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
     Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
     All of one nature, of one substance bred,
     Did lately meet in the intestine shock
     And furious close of civil butchery
     Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
     March all one way and be no more opposed
     Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
     The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
     No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
     As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
     Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
     We are impressed and engaged to fight,
     Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
     Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
     To chase these pagans in those holy fields
     Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
     Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
     For our advantage on the bitter cross.
     But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
     And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
     Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
     Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
     What yesternight our council did decree
     In forwarding this dear expedience.
WESTMORELAND
     My liege, this haste was hot in question,
     And many limits of the charge set down
     But yesternight: when all athwart there came
     A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
     Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
     Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
     Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
     Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
     A thousand of his people butchered;
     Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
     Such beastly shameless transformation,
     By those Welshwomen done as may not be
     Without much shame retold or spoken of.
KING HENRY IV
     It seems then that the tidings of this broil
     Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
WESTMORELAND
     This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
     For more uneven and unwelcome news
     Came from the north and thus it did import:
     On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
     Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
     That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
     At Holmedon met,
     Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
     As by discharge of their artillery,
     And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
     For he that brought them, in the very heat
     And pride of their contention did take horse,
     Uncertain of the issue any way.
KING HENRY IV
     Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
     Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
     Stain'd with the variation of each soil
     Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
     And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
     The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
     Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
     Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
     On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
     Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
     To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
     Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
     And is not this an honourable spoil?
     A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
WESTMORELAND
     In faith,
     It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
KING HENRY IV
     Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
     In envy that my Lord Northumberland
     Should be the father to so blest a son,
     A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
     Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
     Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
     Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
     See riot and dishonour stain the brow
     Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
     That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
     In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
     And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
     Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
     But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
     Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
     Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
     To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
     I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
WESTMORELAND
     This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
     Malevolent to you in all aspects;
     Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
     The crest of youth against your dignity.
KING HENRY IV
     But I have sent for him to answer this;
     And for this cause awhile we must neglect
     Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
     Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
     Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
     But come yourself with speed to us again;
     For more is to be said and to be done
     Than out of anger can be uttered.
WESTMORELAND
     I will, my liege.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's. ****
     Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF
     Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
     and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
     benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
     demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
     What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
     day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
     capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
     signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
     a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
     reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
     the time of the day.
FALSTAFF
     Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
     purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
     by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
     I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
     save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
     thou wilt have none,--
PRINCE HENRY
     What, none?
FALSTAFF
     No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
     prologue to an egg and butter.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
FALSTAFF
     Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
     us that are squires of the night's body be called
     thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
     foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
     moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
     being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
     chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
     fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
     flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
     by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
     most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
     dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
     swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
     now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
     and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
FALSTAFF
     By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
     hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
PRINCE HENRY
     As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
     is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
FALSTAFF
     How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
     thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
     buff jerkin?
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
FALSTAFF
     Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
     time and oft.
PRINCE HENRY
     Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
FALSTAFF
     No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
PRINCE HENRY
     Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
     and where it would not, I have used my credit.
FALSTAFF
     Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
     that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
     wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
     thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
     with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
     not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
PRINCE HENRY
     No; thou shalt.
FALSTAFF
     Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
     the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
FALSTAFF
     Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
     humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
     you.
PRINCE HENRY
     For obtaining of suits?
FALSTAFF
     Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
     hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
     as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
PRINCE HENRY
     Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
FALSTAFF
     Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
PRINCE HENRY
     What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
     Moor-ditch?
FALSTAFF
     Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
     the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
     prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
     with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
     commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
     lord of the council rated me the other day in the
     street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
     he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
     yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
     streets, and no man regards it.
FALSTAFF
     O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
     to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
     me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
     thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
     should speak truly, little better than one of the
     wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
     it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
     I'll be damned for never a king's son in
     Christendom.
PRINCE HENRY
     Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
FALSTAFF
     'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
     do not, call me villain and baffle me.
PRINCE HENRY
     I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
     to purse-taking.
FALSTAFF
     Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
     man to labour in his vocation.
     Enter POINS
     Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
     match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
     hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
     most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
     a true man.
PRINCE HENRY
     Good morrow, Ned.
POINS
     Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
     what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
     agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
     soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
     and a cold capon's leg?
PRINCE HENRY
     Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
     his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
     proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
POINS
     Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
PRINCE HENRY
     Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
POINS
     But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
     o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
     to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
     riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
     for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
     Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
     supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
     as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
     your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
     at home and be hanged.
FALSTAFF
     Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
     I'll hang you for going.
POINS
     You will, chops?
FALSTAFF
     Hal, wilt thou make one?
PRINCE HENRY
     Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
FALSTAFF
     There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
     fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
     royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
FALSTAFF
     Why, that's well said.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
FALSTAFF
     By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
PRINCE HENRY
     I care not.
POINS
     Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
     I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
     that he shall go.
FALSTAFF
     Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
     the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
     move and what he hears may be believed, that the
     true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
     thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
     countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY
     Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
     Exit Falstaff
POINS
     Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
     to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
     manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
     shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
     yourself and I will not be there; and when they
     have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
     this head off from my shoulders.
PRINCE HENRY
     How shall we part with them in setting forth?
POINS
     Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
     appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
     our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
     upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
     no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
PRINCE HENRY
     Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
     horses, by our habits and by every other
     appointment, to be ourselves.
POINS
     Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
     in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
     leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
     for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
PRINCE HENRY
     Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
POINS
     Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
     true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
     third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
     forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
     incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
     tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
     least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
     extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
     lies the jest.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
     necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
     there I'll sup. Farewell.
POINS
     Farewell, my lord.
     Exit Poins
PRINCE HENRY
     I know you all, and will awhile uphold
     The unyoked humour of your idleness:
     Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
     Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
     To smother up his beauty from the world,
     That, when he please again to be himself,
     Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
     By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
     Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
     If all the year were playing holidays,
     To sport would be as tedious as to work;
     But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
     And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
     So, when this loose behavior I throw off
     And pay the debt I never promised,
     By how much better than my word I am,
     By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
     And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
     My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
     Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
     Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
     I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
     Redeeming time when men think least I will.
     Exit
**** SCENE III. London. The palace. ****
     Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT,
     with others
KING HENRY IV
     My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
     Unapt to stir at these indignities,
     And you have found me; for accordingly
     You tread upon my patience: but be sure
     I will from henceforth rather be myself,
     Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
     Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
     And therefore lost that title of respect
     Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
     The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
     And that same greatness too which our own hands
     Have holp to make so portly.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     My lord.--
KING HENRY IV
     Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
     Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
     O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
     And majesty might never yet endure
     The moody frontier of a servant brow.
     You have good leave to leave us: when we need
     Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
     Exit Worcester
     You were about to speak.
     To North
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Yea, my good lord.
     Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
     Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
     Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
     As is deliver'd to your majesty:
     Either envy, therefore, or misprison
     Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
HOTSPUR
     My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
     But I remember, when the fight was done,
     When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
     Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
     Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
     Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
     Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
     He was perfumed like a milliner;
     And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
     A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
     He gave his nose and took't away again;
     Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
     Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
     And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
     He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
     To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
     Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
     With many holiday and lady terms
     He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
     My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
     I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
     To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
     Out of my grief and my impatience,
     Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
     He should or he should not; for he made me mad
     To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
     And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
     Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
     And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
     Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
     And that it was great pity, so it was,
     This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
     Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
     Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
     So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
     He would himself have been a soldier.
     This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
     I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
     And I beseech you, let not his report
     Come current for an accusation
     Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
     Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
     To such a person and in such a place,
     At such a time, with all the rest retold,
     May reasonably die and never rise
     To do him wrong or any way impeach
     What then he said, so he unsay it now.
KING HENRY IV
     Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
     But with proviso and exception,
     That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
     His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
     Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
     The lives of those that he did lead to fight
     Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
     Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
     Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
     Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
     Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
     When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
     No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
     For I shall never hold that man my friend
     Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
     To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
HOTSPUR
     Revolted Mortimer!
     He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
     But by the chance of war; to prove that true
     Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
     Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
     When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
     In single opposition, hand to hand,
     He did confound the best part of an hour
     In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
     Three times they breathed and three times did
     they drink,
     Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
     Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
     Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
     And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
     Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
     Never did base and rotten policy
     Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
     Nor could the noble Mortimer
     Receive so many, and all willingly:
     Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
KING HENRY IV
     Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
     He never did encounter with Glendower:
     I tell thee,
     He durst as well have met the devil alone
     As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
     Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
     Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
     Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
     Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
     As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
     We licence your departure with your son.
     Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
     Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train
HOTSPUR
     An if the devil come and roar for them,
     I will not send them: I will after straight
     And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
     Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
     Here comes your uncle.
     Re-enter WORCESTER
HOTSPUR
     Speak of Mortimer!
     'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
     Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
     Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
     And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
     But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
     As high in the air as this unthankful king,
     As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
HOTSPUR
     He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
     And when I urged the ransom once again
     Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
     And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
     Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
     By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
NORTHUMBERLAND
     He was; I heard the proclamation:
     And then it was when the unhappy king,
     --Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
     Upon his Irish expedition;
     From whence he intercepted did return
     To be deposed and shortly murdered.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
     Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
HOTSPUR
     But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
     Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
     Heir to the crown?
NORTHUMBERLAND
     He did; myself did hear it.
HOTSPUR
     Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
     That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
     But shall it be that you, that set the crown
     Upon the head of this forgetful man
     And for his sake wear the detested blot
     Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
     That you a world of curses undergo,
     Being the agents, or base second means,
     The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
     O, pardon me that I descend so low,
     To show the line and the predicament
     Wherein you range under this subtle king;
     Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
     Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
     That men of your nobility and power
     Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
     As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
     To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
     An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
     And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
     That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
     By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
     No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
     Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
     Into the good thoughts of the world again,
     Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
     Of this proud king, who studies day and night
     To answer all the debt he owes to you
     Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
     Therefore, I say--
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Peace, cousin, say no more:
     And now I will unclasp a secret book,
     And to your quick-conceiving discontents
     I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
     As full of peril and adventurous spirit
     As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
     On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
HOTSPUR
     If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
     Send danger from the east unto the west,
     So honour cross it from the north to south,
     And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
     To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Imagination of some great exploit
     Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
HOTSPUR
     By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
     To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
     Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
     Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
     And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
     So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
     Without corrival, all her dignities:
     But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
EARL OF WORCESTER
     He apprehends a world of figures here,
     But not the form of what he should attend.
     Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
HOTSPUR
     I cry you mercy.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Those same noble Scots
     That are your prisoners,--
HOTSPUR
     I'll keep them all;
     By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
     No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
     I'll keep them, by this hand.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     You start away
     And lend no ear unto my purposes.
     Those prisoners you shall keep.
HOTSPUR
     Nay, I will; that's flat:
     He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
     Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
     But I will find him when he lies asleep,
     And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
     Nay,
     I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
     Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
     To keep his anger still in motion.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Hear you, cousin; a word.
HOTSPUR
     All studies here I solemnly defy,
     Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
     And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
     But that I think his father loves him not
     And would be glad he met with some mischance,
     I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
     When you are better temper'd to attend.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
     Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
     Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
HOTSPUR
     Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
     Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
     Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
     In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
     A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
     'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
     His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
     Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
     'Sblood!--
     When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     At Berkley castle.
HOTSPUR
     You say true:
     Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
     This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
     Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
     And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
     O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
     Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Nay, if you have not, to it again;
     We will stay your leisure.
HOTSPUR
     I have done, i' faith.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
     Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
     And make the Douglas' son your only mean
     For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
     Which I shall send you written, be assured,
     Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
     To Northumberland
     Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
     Shall secretly into the bosom creep
     Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
     The archbishop.
HOTSPUR
     Of York, is it not?
EARL OF WORCESTER
     True; who bears hard
     His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
     I speak not this in estimation,
     As what I think might be, but what I know
     Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
     And only stays but to behold the face
     Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
HOTSPUR
     I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
HOTSPUR
     Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
     And then the power of Scotland and of York,
     To join with Mortimer, ha?
EARL OF WORCESTER
     And so they shall.
HOTSPUR
     In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
     To save our heads by raising of a head;
     For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
     The king will always think him in our debt,
     And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
     Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
     And see already how he doth begin
     To make us strangers to his looks of love.
HOTSPUR
     He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
     Than I by letters shall direct your course.
     When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
     I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
     Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
     As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
     To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
     Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
HOTSPUR
     Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
     Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!
     Exeunt
**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard. ****
     Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand
First Carrier
     Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
     hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
     yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!
Ostler
     [Within] Anon, anon.
First Carrier
     I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
     in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
     of all cess.
     Enter another Carrier
Second Carrier
     Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
     is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
     house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
First Carrier
     Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
     rose; it was the death of him.
Second Carrier
     I think this be the most villanous house in all
     London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
First Carrier
     Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
     christen could be better bit than I have been since
     the first cock.
Second Carrier
     Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
     leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
     fleas like a loach.
First Carrier
     What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
Second Carrier
     I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
     to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
First Carrier
     God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
     starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
     never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
     'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
     on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
     hast thou no faith in thee?
     Enter GADSHILL
GADSHILL
     Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
First Carrier
     I think it be two o'clock.
GADSHILL
     I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
     in the stable.
First Carrier
     Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
GADSHILL
     I pray thee, lend me thine.
Second Carrier
     Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
     he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
GADSHILL
     Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
Second Carrier
     Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
     thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
     gentleman: they will along with company, for they
     have great charge.
     Exeunt carriers
GADSHILL
     What, ho! chamberlain!
Chamberlain
     [Within] At hand, quoth pick-purse.
GADSHILL
     That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
     chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
     of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
     thou layest the plot how.
     Enter Chamberlain
Chamberlain
     Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
     I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
     wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
     him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
     company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
     that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
     They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
     they will away presently.
GADSHILL
     Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
     clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
Chamberlain
     No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
     hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
     as truly as a man of falsehood may.
GADSHILL
     What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
     I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
     Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
     starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
     dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
     content to do the profession some grace; that would,
     if matters should be looked into, for their own
     credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
     foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
     none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
     but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
     great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
     strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
     drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
     I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
     commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
     on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
     her their boots.
Chamberlain
     What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
     out water in foul way?
GADSHILL
     She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
     steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
     of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
Chamberlain
     Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
     the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
GADSHILL
     Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
     purchase, as I am a true man.
Chamberlain
     Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
GADSHILL
     Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
     ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
     you muddy knave.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. The highway, near Gadshill. ****
     Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
POINS
     Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
     horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.
PRINCE HENRY
     Stand close.
     Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF
     Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!
PRINCE HENRY
     Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
     thou keep!
FALSTAFF
     Where's Poins, Hal?
PRINCE HENRY
     He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
FALSTAFF
     I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
     rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
     not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
     further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
     not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
     'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
     forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
     twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
     rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
     medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
     could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
     Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
     I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
     not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
     leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
     ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
     ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
     and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
     a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
     They whistle
     Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
     rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
PRINCE HENRY
     Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
     to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
     of travellers.
FALSTAFF
     Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
     'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
     again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
     What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
FALSTAFF
     I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
     good king's son.
PRINCE HENRY
     Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?
FALSTAFF
     Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
     garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
     have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
     tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
     is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
     Enter GADSHILL, BARDOLPH and PETO
GADSHILL
     Stand.
FALSTAFF
     So I do, against my will.
POINS
     O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
     what news?
BARDOLPH
     Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's
     money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
     to the king's exchequer.
FALSTAFF
     You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.
GADSHILL
     There's enough to make us all.
FALSTAFF
     To be hanged.
PRINCE HENRY
     Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
     Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
     from your encounter, then they light on us.
PETO
     How many be there of them?
GADSHILL
     Some eight or ten.
FALSTAFF
     'Zounds, will they not rob us?
PRINCE HENRY
     What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
FALSTAFF
     Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
     but yet no coward, Hal.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, we leave that to the proof.
POINS
     Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
     when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
     Farewell, and stand fast.
FALSTAFF
     Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.
PRINCE HENRY
     Ned, where are our disguises?
POINS
     Here, hard by: stand close.
     Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS
FALSTAFF
     Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
     every man to his business.
     Enter the Travellers
First Traveller
     Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down
     the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.
Thieves
     Stand!
Travellers
     Jesus bless us!
FALSTAFF
     Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
     ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
     hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.
Travellers
     O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
FALSTAFF
     Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
     fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
     bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
     You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.
     Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt
     Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE HENRY
     The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
     and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
     would be argument for a week, laughter for a month
     and a good jest for ever.
POINS
     Stand close; I hear them coming.
     Enter the Thieves again
FALSTAFF
     Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
     before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
     arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
     no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
PRINCE HENRY
     Your money!
POINS
     Villains!
     As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon them; they all run
     away; and Falstaff, after a blow or two, runs away too, leaving the
     booty behind them
PRINCE HENRY
     Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
     The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
     So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
     Each takes his fellow for an officer.
     Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
     And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
     Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.
POINS
     How the rogue roar'd!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Warkworth castle ****
     Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter
HOTSPUR
     'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well
     contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
     your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,
     then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
     he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
     he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
     purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's
     certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
     drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
     nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
     purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
     have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
     your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
     great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
     unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
     you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
     our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
     friends true and constant: a good plot, good
     friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
     very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
     this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
     general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
     this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
     Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
     Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
     is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
     their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
     next month? and are they not some of them set
     forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
     infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
     of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
     open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
     and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
     skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
     let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
     forward to-night.
     Enter LADY PERCY
     How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.
LADY PERCY
     O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
     For what offence have I this fortnight been
     A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
     Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
     Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
     Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
     And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
     Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
     And given my treasures and my rights of thee
     To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
     In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
     And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
     Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
     Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
     Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
     Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
     Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
     Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
     And all the currents of a heady fight.
     Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
     And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
     That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
     Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
     And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
     Such as we see when men restrain their breath
     On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
     Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
     And I must know it, else he loves me not.
HOTSPUR
     What, ho!
     Enter Servant
     Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
Servant
     He is, my lord, an hour ago.
HOTSPUR
     Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
Servant
     One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
HOTSPUR
     What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
Servant
     It is, my lord.
HOTSPUR
     That roan shall by my throne.
     Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
     Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
     Exit Servant
LADY PERCY
     But hear you, my lord.
HOTSPUR
     What say'st thou, my lady?
LADY PERCY
     What is it carries you away?
HOTSPUR
     Why, my horse, my love, my horse.
LADY PERCY
     Out, you mad-headed ape!
     A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
     As you are toss'd with. In faith,
     I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
     I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
     About his title, and hath sent for you
     To line his enterprise: but if you go,--
HOTSPUR
     So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
LADY PERCY
     Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
     Directly unto this question that I ask:
     In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
     An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
HOTSPUR
     Away,
     Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
     I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
     To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
     We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
     And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
     What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
     have with me?
LADY PERCY
     Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
     Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
     I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
     Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
HOTSPUR
     Come, wilt thou see me ride?
     And when I am on horseback, I will swear
     I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
     I must not have you henceforth question me
     Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
     Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
     This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
     I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
     Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
     But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
     No lady closer; for I well believe
     Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
     And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
LADY PERCY
     How! so far?
HOTSPUR
     Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
     Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
     To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
     Will this content you, Kate?
LADY PERCY
     It must of force.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap. ****
     Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE HENRY
     Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
     thy hand to laugh a little.
POINS
     Where hast been, Hal?
PRINCE HENRY
     With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
     score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
     base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
     to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
     their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
     They take it already upon their salvation, that
     though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
     of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
     like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
     good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
     am king of England, I shall command all the good
     lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
     scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
     cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
     am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
     that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
     during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
     much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
     action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
     Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
     even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
     never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
     shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
     this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
     of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
     drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
     do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
     puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
     thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
     to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
     I'll show thee a precedent.
POINS
     Francis!
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou art perfect.
POINS
     Francis!
     Exit POINS
     Enter FRANCIS
FRANCIS
     Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.
PRINCE HENRY
     Come hither, Francis.
FRANCIS
     My lord?
PRINCE HENRY
     How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
FRANCIS
     Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--
POINS
     [Within] Francis!
FRANCIS
     Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE HENRY
     Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
     of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
     as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
     a fair pair of heels and run from it?
FRANCIS
     O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
     England, I could find in my heart.
POINS
     [Within] Francis!
FRANCIS
     Anon, sir.
PRINCE HENRY
     How old art thou, Francis?
FRANCIS
     Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--
POINS
     [Within] Francis!
FRANCIS
     Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY
     Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
     gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?
FRANCIS
     O Lord, I would it had been two!
PRINCE HENRY
     I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
     when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.
POINS
     [Within] Francis!
FRANCIS
     Anon, anon.
PRINCE HENRY
     Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;
     or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
     thou wilt. But, Francis!
FRANCIS
     My lord?
PRINCE HENRY
     Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
     not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
     smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--
FRANCIS
     O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
     for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
     will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.
FRANCIS
     What, sir?
POINS
     [Within] Francis!
PRINCE HENRY
     Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?
     Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which
     way to go
     Enter Vintner
Vintner
     What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
     calling? Look to the guests within.
     Exit Francis
     My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are
     at the door: shall I let them in?
PRINCE HENRY
     Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
     Exit Vintner
     Poins!
     Re-enter POINS
POINS
     Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE HENRY
     Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
     the door: shall we be merry?
POINS
     As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
     cunning match have you made with this jest of the
     drawer? come, what's the issue?
PRINCE HENRY
     I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
     humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
     pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
     Re-enter FRANCIS
     What's o'clock, Francis?
FRANCIS
     Anon, anon, sir.
     Exit
PRINCE HENRY
     That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
     parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
     upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
     a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
     Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
     seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
     hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
     life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
     'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
     horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
     fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
     prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
     that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
     wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
     Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with
     wine
POINS
     Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?
FALSTAFF
     A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
     marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
     lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
     them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
     Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
     He drinks
PRINCE HENRY
     Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
     pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
     of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
FALSTAFF
     You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
     nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
     yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
     in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
     die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
     not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
     shotten herring. There live not three good men
     unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
     grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
     I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
     thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.
PRINCE HENRY
     How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?
FALSTAFF
     A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
     kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
     subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
     I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
FALSTAFF
     Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?
POINS
     'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
     Lord, I'll stab thee.
FALSTAFF
     I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
     thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
     could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
     enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
     back: call you that backing of your friends? A
     plague upon such backing! give me them that will
     face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
     drunk to-day.
PRINCE HENRY
     O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
     drunkest last.
FALSTAFF
     All's one for that.
     He drinks
     A plague of all cowards, still say I.
PRINCE HENRY
     What's the matter?
FALSTAFF
     What's the matter! there be four of us here have
     ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
PRINCE HENRY
     Where is it, Jack? where is it?
FALSTAFF
     Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
     poor four of us.
PRINCE HENRY
     What, a hundred, man?
FALSTAFF
     I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
     dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
     miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
     doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
     through and through; my sword hacked like a
     hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
     I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
     cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
     less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
PRINCE HENRY
     Speak, sirs; how was it?
GADSHILL
     We four set upon some dozen--
FALSTAFF
     Sixteen at least, my lord.
GADSHILL
     And bound them.
PETO
     No, no, they were not bound.
FALSTAFF
     You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
     am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
GADSHILL
     As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
FALSTAFF
     And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
PRINCE HENRY
     What, fought you with them all?
FALSTAFF
     All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
     not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
     there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
     Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
PRINCE HENRY
     Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
FALSTAFF
     Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
     of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
     in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
     thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
     knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
     point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
PRINCE HENRY
     What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
FALSTAFF
     Four, Hal; I told thee four.
POINS
     Ay, ay, he said four.
FALSTAFF
     These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
     me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
     points in my target, thus.
PRINCE HENRY
     Seven? why, there were but four even now.
FALSTAFF
     In buckram?
POINS
     Ay, four, in buckram suits.
FALSTAFF
     Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
PRINCE HENRY
     Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
FALSTAFF
     Dost thou hear me, Hal?
PRINCE HENRY
     Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
FALSTAFF
     Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
     in buckram that I told thee of--
PRINCE HENRY
     So, two more already.
FALSTAFF
     Their points being broken,--
POINS
     Down fell their hose.
FALSTAFF
     Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
     came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
     the eleven I paid.
PRINCE HENRY
     O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
FALSTAFF
     But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
     knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
     at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
     not see thy hand.
PRINCE HENRY
     These lies are like their father that begets them;
     gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
     clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
     whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
FALSTAFF
     What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
     the truth?
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
     green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
     hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
POINS
     Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
FALSTAFF
     What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
     strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
     not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
     compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
     blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
     compulsion, I.
PRINCE HENRY
     I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
     coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
     this huge hill of flesh,--
FALSTAFF
     'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
     neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
     for breath to utter what is like thee! you
     tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
     standing-tuck,--
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
     when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
     hear me speak but this.
POINS
     Mark, Jack.
PRINCE HENRY
     We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
     were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
     tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
     four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
     prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
     the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
     away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
     for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
     bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
     as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
     What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
     thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
     apparent shame?
POINS
     Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
FALSTAFF
     By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
     Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
     heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
     why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
     beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
     prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
     coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
     myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
     lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
     lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
     to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
     Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
     of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
     merry? shall we have a play extempore?
PRINCE HENRY
     Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.
FALSTAFF
     Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
     Enter Hostess
Hostess
     O Jesu, my lord the prince!
PRINCE HENRY
     How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
     me?
Hostess
     Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
     door would speak with you: he says he comes from
     your father.
PRINCE HENRY
     Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
     send him back again to my mother.
FALSTAFF
     What manner of man is he?
Hostess
     An old man.
FALSTAFF
     What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
     I give him his answer?
PRINCE HENRY
     Prithee, do, Jack.
FALSTAFF
     'Faith, and I'll send him packing.
     Exit FALSTAFF
PRINCE HENRY
     Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
     Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
     ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
     prince; no, fie!
BARDOLPH
     'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
PRINCE HENRY
     'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
     sword so hacked?
PETO
     Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
     swear truth out of England but he would make you
     believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
BARDOLPH
     Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
     make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
     with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
     did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
     to hear his monstrous devices.
PRINCE HENRY
     O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
     ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
     thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
     sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
     instinct hadst thou for it?
BARDOLPH
     My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
     these exhalations?
PRINCE HENRY
     I do.
BARDOLPH
     What think you they portend?
PRINCE HENRY
     Hot livers and cold purses.
BARDOLPH
     Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
PRINCE HENRY
     No, if rightly taken, halter.
     Re-enter FALSTAFF
     Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
     How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
     How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
FALSTAFF
     My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
     not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
     crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
     sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
     bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
     Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
     court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
     north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
     bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
     devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
     hook--what a plague call you him?
POINS
     O, Glendower.
FALSTAFF
     Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
     and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
     Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
     perpendicular,--
PRINCE HENRY
     He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
     kills a sparrow flying.
FALSTAFF
     You have hit it.
PRINCE HENRY
     So did he never the sparrow.
FALSTAFF
     Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
     for running!
FALSTAFF
     O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.
PRINCE HENRY
     Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
FALSTAFF
     I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
     and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
     Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
     beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
     land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
     this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
     as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.
FALSTAFF
     By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
     shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
     art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
     heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
     such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
     spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
     not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
     it?
PRINCE HENRY
     Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
FALSTAFF
     Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
     comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
PRINCE HENRY
     Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
     particulars of my life.
FALSTAFF
     Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
     this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
PRINCE HENRY
     Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
     sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
     crown for a pitiful bald crown!
FALSTAFF
     Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
     now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
     make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
     wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
     in King Cambyses' vein.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, here is my leg.
FALSTAFF
     And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
Hostess
     O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
FALSTAFF
     Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.
Hostess
     O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
FALSTAFF
     For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
     For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
Hostess
     O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
     players as ever I see!
FALSTAFF
     Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
     Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
     time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
     the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
     it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
     sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
     partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
     but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
     foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
     me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
     why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
     the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
     blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
     the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
     question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
     which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
     many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
     as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
     the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
     speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
     pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
     woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
     have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
PRINCE HENRY
     What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
FALSTAFF
     A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
     cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
     carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
     by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
     remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
     should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
     I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
     known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
     peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
     Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
     me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
     thou been this month?
PRINCE HENRY
     Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
     and I'll play my father.
FALSTAFF
     Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
     majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
     the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
PRINCE HENRY
     Well, here I am set.
FALSTAFF
     And here I stand: judge, my masters.
PRINCE HENRY
     Now, Harry, whence come you?
FALSTAFF
     My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY
     The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
FALSTAFF
     'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
     ye for a young prince, i' faith.
PRINCE HENRY
     Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
     on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
     there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
     old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
     dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
     bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
     of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
     cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
     the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
     grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
     years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
     drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
     capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
     wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
     but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
FALSTAFF
     I would your grace would take me with you: whom
     means your grace?
PRINCE HENRY
     That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
     Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
FALSTAFF
     My lord, the man I know.
PRINCE HENRY
     I know thou dost.
FALSTAFF
     But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
     were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
     more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
     that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
     that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
     God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
     sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
     to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
     are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
     banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
     Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
     valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
     being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
     thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
     company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
PRINCE HENRY
     I do, I will.
     A knocking heard
     Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH
     Re-enter BARDOLPH, running
BARDOLPH
     O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
     monstrous watch is at the door.
FALSTAFF
     Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
     say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
     Re-enter the Hostess
Hostess
     O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
PRINCE HENRY
     Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
     what's the matter?
Hostess
     The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
     are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
FALSTAFF
     Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
     gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
     without seeming so.
PRINCE HENRY
     And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
FALSTAFF
     I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
     so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
     as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
     I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
PRINCE HENRY
     Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
     above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
     conscience.
FALSTAFF
     Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
     therefore I'll hide me.
PRINCE HENRY
     Call in the sheriff.
     Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO
     Enter Sheriff and the Carrier
     Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
Sheriff
     First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
     Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
PRINCE HENRY
     What men?
Sheriff
     One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
     A gross fat man.
Carrier
     As fat as butter.
PRINCE HENRY
     The man, I do assure you, is not here;
     For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
     And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
     That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
     Send him to answer thee, or any man,
     For any thing he shall be charged withal:
     And so let me entreat you leave the house.
Sheriff
     I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
     Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
PRINCE HENRY
     It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
     He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
Sheriff
     Good night, my noble lord.
PRINCE HENRY
     I think it is good morrow, is it not?
Sheriff
     Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
     Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier
PRINCE HENRY
     This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
     call him forth.
PETO
     Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
     snorting like a horse.
PRINCE HENRY
     Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
     He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers
     What hast thou found?
PETO
     Nothing but papers, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY
     Let's see what they be: read them.
PETO
     [Reads] Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.
     Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
     Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
     Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
     Item, Bread, ob.
PRINCE HENRY
     O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
     this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
     keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
     let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
     morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
     shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
     charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
     march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
     back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
     the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.
     Exeunt
PETO
     Good morrow, good my lord.
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house. ****
     Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER
MORTIMER
     These promises are fair, the parties sure,
     And our induction full of prosperous hope.
HOTSPUR
     Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
     Will you sit down?
     And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
     I have forgot the map.
GLENDOWER
     No, here it is.
     Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
     For by that name as oft as Lancaster
     Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
     A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
HOTSPUR
     And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
GLENDOWER
     I cannot blame him: at my nativity
     The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
     Of burning cressets; and at my birth
     The frame and huge foundation of the earth
     Shaked like a coward.
HOTSPUR
     Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
     your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
     had never been born.
GLENDOWER
     I say the earth did shake when I was born.
HOTSPUR
     And I say the earth was not of my mind,
     If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
GLENDOWER
     The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
HOTSPUR
     O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
     And not in fear of your nativity.
     Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
     In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
     Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
     By the imprisoning of unruly wind
     Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
     Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
     Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
     Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
     In passion shook.
GLENDOWER
     Cousin, of many men
     I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
     To tell you once again that at my birth
     The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
     The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
     Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
     These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
     And all the courses of my life do show
     I am not in the roll of common men.
     Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
     That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
     Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
     And bring him out that is but woman's son
     Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
     And hold me pace in deep experiments.
HOTSPUR
     I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
     I'll to dinner.
MORTIMER
     Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
GLENDOWER
     I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
HOTSPUR
     Why, so can I, or so can any man;
     But will they come when you do call for them?
GLENDOWER
     Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
     The devil.
HOTSPUR
     And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
     By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
     If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
     And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
     O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
MORTIMER
     Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
GLENDOWER
     Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
     Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
     And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
     Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
HOTSPUR
     Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
     How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
GLENDOWER
     Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
     According to our threefold order ta'en?
MORTIMER
     The archdeacon hath divided it
     Into three limits very equally:
     England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
     By south and east is to my part assign'd:
     All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
     And all the fertile land within that bound,
     To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
     The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
     And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
     Which being sealed interchangeably,
     A business that this night may execute,
     To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
     And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
     To meet your father and the Scottish power,
     As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
     My father Glendower is not ready yet,
     Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
     Within that space you may have drawn together
     Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
GLENDOWER
     A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
     And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
     From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
     For there will be a world of water shed
     Upon the parting of your wives and you.
HOTSPUR
     Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
     In quantity equals not one of yours:
     See how this river comes me cranking in,
     And cuts me from the best of all my land
     A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
     I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
     And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
     In a new channel, fair and evenly;
     It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
     To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
GLENDOWER
     Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
MORTIMER
     Yea, but
     Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
     With like advantage on the other side;
     Gelding the opposed continent as much
     As on the other side it takes from you.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
     And on this north side win this cape of land;
     And then he runs straight and even.
HOTSPUR
     I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
GLENDOWER
     I'll not have it alter'd.
HOTSPUR
     Will not you?
GLENDOWER
     No, nor you shall not.
HOTSPUR
     Who shall say me nay?
GLENDOWER
     Why, that will I.
HOTSPUR
     Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
GLENDOWER
     I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
     For I was train'd up in the English court;
     Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
     Many an English ditty lovely well
     And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
     A virtue that was never seen in you.
HOTSPUR
     Marry,
     And I am glad of it with all my heart:
     I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
     Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
     I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
     Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
     And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
     Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
     'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
GLENDOWER
     Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
HOTSPUR
     I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
     To any well-deserving friend;
     But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
     I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
     Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
GLENDOWER
     The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
     I'll haste the writer and withal
     Break with your wives of your departure hence:
     I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
     So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
     Exit GLENDOWER
MORTIMER
     Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
HOTSPUR
     I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
     With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
     Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
     And of a dragon and a finless fish,
     A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
     A couching lion and a ramping cat,
     And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
     As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
     He held me last night at least nine hours
     In reckoning up the several devils' names
     That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
     But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
     As a tired horse, a railing wife;
     Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
     With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
     Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
     In any summer-house in Christendom.
MORTIMER
     In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
     Exceedingly well read, and profited
     In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
     And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
     As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
     He holds your temper in a high respect
     And curbs himself even of his natural scope
     When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
     I warrant you, that man is not alive
     Might so have tempted him as you have done,
     Without the taste of danger and reproof:
     But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
     And since your coming hither have done enough
     To put him quite beside his patience.
     You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
     Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
     And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
     Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
     Defect of manners, want of government,
     Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
     The least of which haunting a nobleman
     Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
     Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
     Beguiling them of commendation.
HOTSPUR
     Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
     Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
     Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
MORTIMER
     This is the deadly spite that angers me;
     My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
GLENDOWER
     My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
     She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
MORTIMER
     Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
     Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
     Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same
GLENDOWER
     She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
     one that no persuasion can do good upon.
     The lady speaks in Welsh
MORTIMER
     I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
     Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
     I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
     In such a parley should I answer thee.
     The lady speaks again in Welsh
     I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
     And that's a feeling disputation:
     But I will never be a truant, love,
     Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
     Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
     Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
     With ravishing division, to her lute.
GLENDOWER
     Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
     The lady speaks again in Welsh
MORTIMER
     O, I am ignorance itself in this!
GLENDOWER
     She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
     And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
     And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
     And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
     Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
     Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
     As is the difference betwixt day and night
     The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
     Begins his golden progress in the east.
MORTIMER
     With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
     By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
GLENDOWER
     Do so;
     And those musicians that shall play to you
     Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
     And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
HOTSPUR
     Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
     quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
LADY PERCY
     Go, ye giddy goose.
     The music plays
HOTSPUR
     Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
     And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
     By'r lady, he is a good musician.
LADY PERCY
     Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
     altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
     and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
HOTSPUR
     I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
LADY PERCY
     Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
HOTSPUR
     No.
LADY PERCY
     Then be still.
HOTSPUR
     Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
LADY PERCY
     Now God help thee!
HOTSPUR
     To the Welsh lady's bed.
LADY PERCY
     What's that?
HOTSPUR
     Peace! she sings.
     Here the lady sings a Welsh song
HOTSPUR
     Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
LADY PERCY
     Not mine, in good sooth.
HOTSPUR
     Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
     comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
     'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
     'as sure as day,'
     And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
     As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
     Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
     A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
     And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
     To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
     Come, sing.
LADY PERCY
     I will not sing.
HOTSPUR
     'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
     teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
     within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.
     Exit
GLENDOWER
     Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
     As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
     By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
     And then to horse immediately.
MORTIMER
     With all my heart.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. The palace. ****
     Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others
KING HENRY IV
     Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
     Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
     For we shall presently have need of you.
     Exeunt Lords
     I know not whether God will have it so,
     For some displeasing service I have done,
     That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
     He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
     But thou dost in thy passages of life
     Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
     For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
     To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
     Could such inordinate and low desires,
     Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
     Such barren pleasures, rude society,
     As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
     Accompany the greatness of thy blood
     And hold their level with thy princely heart?
PRINCE HENRY
     So please your majesty, I would I could
     Quit all offences with as clear excuse
     As well as I am doubtless I can purge
     Myself of many I am charged withal:
     Yet such extenuation let me beg,
     As, in reproof of many tales devised,
     which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
     By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
     I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
     Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
     Find pardon on my true submission.
KING HENRY IV
     God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
     At thy affections, which do hold a wing
     Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
     Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
     Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
     And art almost an alien to the hearts
     Of all the court and princes of my blood:
     The hope and expectation of thy time
     Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
     Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
     Had I so lavish of my presence been,
     So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
     So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
     Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
     Had still kept loyal to possession
     And left me in reputeless banishment,
     A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
     By being seldom seen, I could not stir
     But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
     That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
     Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
     And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
     And dress'd myself in such humility
     That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
     Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
     Even in the presence of the crowned king.
     Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
     My presence, like a robe pontifical,
     Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
     Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
     And won by rareness such solemnity.
     The skipping king, he ambled up and down
     With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
     Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
     Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
     Had his great name profaned with their scorns
     And gave his countenance, against his name,
     To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
     Of every beardless vain comparative,
     Grew a companion to the common streets,
     Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
     That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
     They surfeited with honey and began
     To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
     More than a little is by much too much.
     So when he had occasion to be seen,
     He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
     Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
     As, sick and blunted with community,
     Afford no extraordinary gaze,
     Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
     When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
     But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
     Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
     As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
     Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
     And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
     For thou has lost thy princely privilege
     With vile participation: not an eye
     But is a-weary of thy common sight,
     Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
     Which now doth that I would not have it do,
     Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
PRINCE HENRY
     I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
     Be more myself.
KING HENRY IV
     For all the world
     As thou art to this hour was Richard then
     When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
     And even as I was then is Percy now.
     Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
     He hath more worthy interest to the state
     Than thou the shadow of succession;
     For of no right, nor colour like to right,
     He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
     Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
     And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
     Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
     To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
     What never-dying honour hath he got
     Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
     Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
     Holds from all soldiers chief majority
     And military title capital
     Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
     Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
     This infant warrior, in his enterprises
     Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
     Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
     To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
     And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
     And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
     The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
     Capitulate against us and are up.
     But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
     Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
     Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
     Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
     Base inclination and the start of spleen
     To fight against me under Percy's pay,
     To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
     To show how much thou art degenerate.
PRINCE HENRY
     Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
     And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
     Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
     I will redeem all this on Percy's head
     And in the closing of some glorious day
     Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
     When I will wear a garment all of blood
     And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
     Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
     And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
     That this same child of honour and renown,
     This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
     And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
     For every honour sitting on his helm,
     Would they were multitudes, and on my head
     My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
     That I shall make this northern youth exchange
     His glorious deeds for my indignities.
     Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
     To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
     And I will call him to so strict account,
     That he shall render every glory up,
     Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
     Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
     This, in the name of God, I promise here:
     The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
     I do beseech your majesty may salve
     The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
     If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
     And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
     Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
KING HENRY IV
     A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
     Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
     Enter BLUNT
     How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     So hath the business that I come to speak of.
     Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
     That Douglas and the English rebels met
     The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
     A mighty and a fearful head they are,
     If promises be kept on every hand,
     As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
KING HENRY IV
     The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
     With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
     For this advertisement is five days old:
     On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
     On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
     Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
     Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
     Our business valued, some twelve days hence
     Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
     Our hands are full of business: let's away;
     Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.
     Exeunt
Scene III
     Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
     Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF
     Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
     action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
     skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
     gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
     I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
     liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
     shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
     forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
     am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
     church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
     spoil of me.
BARDOLPH
     Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
FALSTAFF
     Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
     me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
     need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
     above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
     in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
     borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
     good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
     of all compass.
BARDOLPH
     Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
     be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
     compass, Sir John.
FALSTAFF
     Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
     thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
     the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
     Knight of the Burning Lamp.
BARDOLPH
     Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
FALSTAFF
     No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
     a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
     never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
     Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
     robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
     given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
     should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
     thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
     for the light in thy face, the son of utter
     darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
     night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
     hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
     there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
     perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
     Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
     torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
     tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
     drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
     at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
     maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
     time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
     it!
BARDOLPH
     'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
FALSTAFF
     God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
     Enter Hostess
     How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
     yet who picked my pocket?
Hostess
     Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
     think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
     I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
     by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
     was never lost in my house before.
FALSTAFF
     Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
     a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
     to, you are a woman, go.
Hostess
     Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
     called so in mine own house before.
FALSTAFF
     Go to, I know you well enough.
Hostess
     No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
     you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
     you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
     you a dozen of shirts to your back.
FALSTAFF
     Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
     bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
Hostess
     Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
     shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
     John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
     you, four and twenty pound.
FALSTAFF
     He had his part of it; let him pay.
Hostess
     He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
FALSTAFF
     How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
     let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
     Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
     of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
     shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
     seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
Hostess
     O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
     how oft, that ring was copper!
FALSTAFF
     How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
     he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
     would say so.
     Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them
     playing on his truncheon like a life
     How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
     must we all march?
BARDOLPH
     Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
Hostess
     My lord, I pray you, hear me.
PRINCE HENRY
     What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
     husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
Hostess
     Good my lord, hear me.
FALSTAFF
     Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
PRINCE HENRY
     What sayest thou, Jack?
FALSTAFF
     The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
     and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
     bawdy-house; they pick pockets.
PRINCE HENRY
     What didst thou lose, Jack?
FALSTAFF
     Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
     forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
     grandfather's.
PRINCE HENRY
     A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
Hostess
     So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
     grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
     of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
     he would cudgel you.
PRINCE HENRY
     What! he did not?
Hostess
     There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
FALSTAFF
     There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
     prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
     fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
     deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
     go
Hostess
     Say, what thing? what thing?
FALSTAFF
     What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
Hostess
     I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
     shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
     setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
     call me so.
FALSTAFF
     Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
     otherwise.
Hostess
     Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
FALSTAFF
     What beast! why, an otter.
PRINCE HENRY
     An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
FALSTAFF
     Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
     where to have her.
Hostess
     Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
     man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.
Hostess
     So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
     ought him a thousand pound.
PRINCE HENRY
     Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
FALSTAFF
     A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
     a million: thou owest me thy love.
Hostess
     Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
     cudgel you.
FALSTAFF
     Did I, Bardolph?
BARDOLPH
     Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
FALSTAFF
     Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
PRINCE HENRY
     I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
FALSTAFF
     Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
     but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
     roaring of a lion's whelp.
PRINCE HENRY
     And why not as the lion?
FALSTAFF
     The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
     think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
     I do, I pray God my girdle break.
PRINCE HENRY
     O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
     knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
     truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
     filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
     woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
     impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
     thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
     bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
     sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
     were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
     am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
     not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
FALSTAFF
     Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
     innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
     Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
     have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
     frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
PRINCE HENRY
     It appears so by the story.
FALSTAFF
     Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
     love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
     guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
     reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
     prithee, be gone.
     Exit Hostess
     Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
     lad, how is that answered?
PRINCE HENRY
     O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
     thee: the money is paid back again.
FALSTAFF
     O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.
PRINCE HENRY
     I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
FALSTAFF
     Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
     do it with unwashed hands too.
BARDOLPH
     Do, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY
     I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
FALSTAFF
     I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
     one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
     age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
     heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
     these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
     laud them, I praise them.
PRINCE HENRY
     Bardolph!
BARDOLPH
     My lord?
PRINCE HENRY
     Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
     brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
     Exit Bardolph
     Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
     thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
     Exit Peto
     Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
     o'clock in the afternoon.
     There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
     Money and order for their furniture.
     The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
     And either we or they must lower lie.
     Exit PRINCE HENRY
FALSTAFF
     Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
     O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
     Exit
**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury. ****
     Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS
HOTSPUR
     Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
     In this fine age were not thought flattery,
     Such attribution should the Douglas have,
     As not a soldier of this season's stamp
     Should go so general current through the world.
     By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy
     The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
     In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
     Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Thou art the king of honour:
     No man so potent breathes upon the ground
     But I will beard him.
HOTSPUR
     Do so, and 'tis well.
     Enter a Messenger with letters
     What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
Messenger
     These letters come from your father.
HOTSPUR
     Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
Messenger
     He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
HOTSPUR
     'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
     In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
     Under whose government come they along?
Messenger
     His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
Messenger
     He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
     And at the time of my departure thence
     He was much fear'd by his physicians.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     I would the state of time had first been whole
     Ere he by sickness had been visited:
     His health was never better worth than now.
HOTSPUR
     Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
     The very life-blood of our enterprise;
     'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
     He writes me here, that inward sickness--
     And that his friends by deputation could not
     So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
     To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
     On any soul removed but on his own.
     Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
     That with our small conjunction we should on,
     To see how fortune is disposed to us;
     For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
     Because the king is certainly possess'd
     Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
HOTSPUR
     A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
     And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
     Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
     To set the exact wealth of all our states
     All at one cast? to set so rich a main
     On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
     It were not good; for therein should we read
     The very bottom and the soul of hope,
     The very list, the very utmost bound
     Of all our fortunes.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     'Faith, and so we should;
     Where now remains a sweet reversion:
     We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
     Is to come in:
     A comfort of retirement lives in this.
HOTSPUR
     A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
     If that the devil and mischance look big
     Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     But yet I would your father had been here.
     The quality and hair of our attempt
     Brooks no division: it will be thought
     By some, that know not why he is away,
     That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
     Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
     And think how such an apprehension
     May turn the tide of fearful faction
     And breed a kind of question in our cause;
     For well you know we of the offering side
     Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
     And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
     The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
     This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
     That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
     Before not dreamt of.
HOTSPUR
     You strain too far.
     I rather of his absence make this use:
     It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
     A larger dare to our great enterprise,
     Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
     If we without his help can make a head
     To push against a kingdom, with his help
     We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
     Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     As heart can think: there is not such a word
     Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
     Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
HOTSPUR
     My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
VERNON
     Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
     The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
     Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.
HOTSPUR
     No harm: what more?
VERNON
     And further, I have learn'd,
     The king himself in person is set forth,
     Or hitherwards intended speedily,
     With strong and mighty preparation.
HOTSPUR
     He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
     The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
     And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
     And bid it pass?
VERNON
     All furnish'd, all in arms;
     All plumed like estridges that with the wind
     Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
     Glittering in golden coats, like images;
     As full of spirit as the month of May,
     And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
     Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
     I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
     His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
     Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
     And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
     As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
     To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
     And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
HOTSPUR
     No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
     This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
     They come like sacrifices in their trim,
     And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
     All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
     The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
     Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
     To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
     And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
     Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
     Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
     Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
     Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
     O that Glendower were come!
VERNON
     There is more news:
     I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
     He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
WORCESTER
     Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
HOTSPUR
     What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
VERNON
     To thirty thousand.
HOTSPUR
     Forty let it be:
     My father and Glendower being both away,
     The powers of us may serve so great a day
     Come, let us take a muster speedily:
     Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
     Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A public road near Coventry. ****
     Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
FALSTAFF
     Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
     bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
     we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
BARDOLPH
     Will you give me money, captain?
FALSTAFF
     Lay out, lay out.
BARDOLPH
     This bottle makes an angel.
FALSTAFF
     An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
     twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
     my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
BARDOLPH
     I will, captain: farewell.
     Exit
FALSTAFF
     If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
     gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
     I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
     soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
     none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
     me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
     twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
     as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
     fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
     fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
     toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
     bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
     their services; and now my whole charge consists of
     ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
     companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
     painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
     sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
     discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
     younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
     trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
     long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
     an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
     the rooms of them that have bought out their
     services, that you would think that I had a hundred
     and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
     swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
     fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
     all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
     hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
     Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
     villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
     gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
     prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
     company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
     together and thrown over the shoulders like an
     herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
     the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
     the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
     one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
     Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
PRINCE HENRY
     How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!
FALSTAFF
     What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
     in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
     cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
     at Shrewsbury.
WESTMORELAND
     Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
     there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
     The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
     away all night.
FALSTAFF
     Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
     steal cream.
PRINCE HENRY
     I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
     already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
     fellows are these that come after?
FALSTAFF
     Mine, Hal, mine.
PRINCE HENRY
     I did never see such pitiful rascals.
FALSTAFF
     Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
     for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
     tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
WESTMORELAND
     Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
     and bare, too beggarly.
FALSTAFF
     'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
     that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
     learned that of me.
PRINCE HENRY
     No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
     the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
     already in the field.
FALSTAFF
     What, is the king encamped?
WESTMORELAND
     He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
FALSTAFF
     Well,
     To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
     Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

**** SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury. ****
     Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON
HOTSPUR
     We'll fight with him to-night.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     It may not be.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     You give him then the advantage.
VERNON
     Not a whit.
HOTSPUR
     Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
VERNON
     So do we.
HOTSPUR
     His is certain, ours is doubtful.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
VERNON
     Do not, my lord.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     You do not counsel well:
     You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
VERNON
     Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
     And I dare well maintain it with my life,
     If well-respected honour bid me on,
     I hold as little counsel with weak fear
     As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:
     Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
     Which of us fears.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Yea, or to-night.
VERNON
     Content.
HOTSPUR
     To-night, say I.
VERNON
     Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
     Being men of such great leading as you are,
     That you foresee not what impediments
     Drag back our expedition: certain horse
     Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
     Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
     And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
     Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
     That not a horse is half the half of himself.
HOTSPUR
     So are the horses of the enemy
     In general, journey-bated and brought low:
     The better part of ours are full of rest.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     The number of the king exceedeth ours:
     For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.
     The trumpet sounds a parley
     Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     I come with gracious offers from the king,
     if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
HOTSPUR
     Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
     You were of our determination!
     Some of us love you well; and even those some
     Envy your great deservings and good name,
     Because you are not of our quality,
     But stand against us like an enemy.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     And God defend but still I should stand so,
     So long as out of limit and true rule
     You stand against anointed majesty.
     But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
     The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
     You conjure from the breast of civil peace
     Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
     Audacious cruelty. If that the king
     Have any way your good deserts forgot,
     Which he confesseth to be manifold,
     He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
     You shall have your desires with interest
     And pardon absolute for yourself and these
     Herein misled by your suggestion.
HOTSPUR
     The king is kind; and well we know the king
     Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
     My father and my uncle and myself
     Did give him that same royalty he wears;
     And when he was not six and twenty strong,
     Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
     A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
     My father gave him welcome to the shore;
     And when he heard him swear and vow to God
     He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
     To sue his livery and beg his peace,
     With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
     My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
     Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
     Now when the lords and barons of the realm
     Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
     The more and less came in with cap and knee;
     Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
     Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
     Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
     Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
     Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
     He presently, as greatness knows itself,
     Steps me a little higher than his vow
     Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
     Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
     And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
     Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
     That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
     Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
     Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
     This seeming brow of justice, did he win
     The hearts of all that he did angle for;
     Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
     Of all the favourites that the absent king
     In deputation left behind him here,
     When he was personal in the Irish war.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     Tut, I came not to hear this.
HOTSPUR
     Then to the point.
     In short time after, he deposed the king;
     Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
     And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
     To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
     Who is, if every owner were well placed,
     Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
     There without ransom to lie forfeited;
     Disgraced me in my happy victories,
     Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
     Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
     In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
     Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
     And in conclusion drove us to seek out
     This head of safety; and withal to pry
     Into his title, the which we find
     Too indirect for long continuance.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     Shall I return this answer to the king?
HOTSPUR
     Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
     Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
     Some surety for a safe return again,
     And in the morning early shall my uncle
     Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     I would you would accept of grace and love.
HOTSPUR
     And may be so we shall.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     Pray God you do.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace. ****
     Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
     With winged haste to the lord marshal;
     This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
     To whom they are directed. If you knew
     How much they do to import, you would make haste.
SIR MICHAEL
     My good lord,
     I guess their tenor.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     Like enough you do.
     To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
     Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
     Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
     As I am truly given to understand,
     The king with mighty and quick-raised power
     Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
     What with the sickness of Northumberland,
     Whose power was in the first proportion,
     And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
     Who with them was a rated sinew too
     And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
     I fear the power of Percy is too weak
     To wage an instant trial with the king.
SIR MICHAEL
     Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
     There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     No, Mortimer is not there.
SIR MICHAEL
     But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
     And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
     Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
     The special head of all the land together:
     The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
     The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
     And moe corrivals and dear men
     Of estimation and command in arms.
SIR MICHAEL
     Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
     I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
     And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
     For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
     Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
     For he hath heard of our confederacy,
     And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
     Therefore make haste. I must go write again
     To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury. ****
     Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of LANCASTER, EARL OF
     WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF
KING HENRY IV
     How bloodily the sun begins to peer
     Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
     At his distemperature.
PRINCE HENRY
     The southern wind
     Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
     And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
     Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
KING HENRY IV
     Then with the losers let it sympathize,
     For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
     The trumpet sounds
     Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
     How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
     That you and I should meet upon such terms
     As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
     And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
     To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
     This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
     What say you to it? will you again unknit
     This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
     And move in that obedient orb again
     Where you did give a fair and natural light,
     And be no more an exhaled meteor,
     A prodigy of fear and a portent
     Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Hear me, my liege:
     For mine own part, I could be well content
     To entertain the lag-end of my life
     With quiet hours; for I do protest,
     I have not sought the day of this dislike.
KING HENRY IV
     You have not sought it! how comes it, then?
FALSTAFF
     Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
PRINCE HENRY
     Peace, chewet, peace!
EARL OF WORCESTER
     It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
     Of favour from myself and all our house;
     And yet I must remember you, my lord,
     We were the first and dearest of your friends.
     For you my staff of office did I break
     In Richard's time; and posted day and night
     to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
     When yet you were in place and in account
     Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
     It was myself, my brother and his son,
     That brought you home and boldly did outdare
     The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
     And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
     That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
     Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
     The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
     To this we swore our aid. But in short space
     It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
     And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
     What with our help, what with the absent king,
     What with the injuries of a wanton time,
     The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
     And the contrarious winds that held the king
     So long in his unlucky Irish wars
     That all in England did repute him dead:
     And from this swarm of fair advantages
     You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
     To gripe the general sway into your hand;
     Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
     And being fed by us you used us so
     As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
     Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
     Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
     That even our love durst not come near your sight
     For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
     We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
     Out of sight and raise this present head;
     Whereby we stand opposed by such means
     As you yourself have forged against yourself
     By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
     And violation of all faith and troth
     Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
KING HENRY IV
     These things indeed you have articulate,
     Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
     To face the garment of rebellion
     With some fine colour that may please the eye
     Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
     Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
     Of hurlyburly innovation:
     And never yet did insurrection want
     Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
     Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
     Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
PRINCE HENRY
     In both your armies there is many a soul
     Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
     If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
     The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
     In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
     This present enterprise set off his head,
     I do not think a braver gentleman,
     More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
     More daring or more bold, is now alive
     To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
     For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
     I have a truant been to chivalry;
     And so I hear he doth account me too;
     Yet this before my father's majesty--
     I am content that he shall take the odds
     Of his great name and estimation,
     And will, to save the blood on either side,
     Try fortune with him in a single fight.
KING HENRY IV
     And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
     Albeit considerations infinite
     Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
     We love our people well; even those we love
     That are misled upon your cousin's part;
     And, will they take the offer of our grace,
     Both he and they and you, every man
     Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
     So tell your cousin, and bring me word
     What he will do: but if he will not yield,
     Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
     And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
     We will not now be troubled with reply:
     We offer fair; take it advisedly.
     Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
PRINCE HENRY
     It will not be accepted, on my life:
     The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
     Are confident against the world in arms.
KING HENRY IV
     Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
     For, on their answer, will we set on them:
     And God befriend us, as our cause is just!
     Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF
     Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
     me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
PRINCE HENRY
     Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
     Say thy prayers, and farewell.
FALSTAFF
     I would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, thou owest God a death.
     Exit PRINCE HENRY
FALSTAFF
     'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
     his day. What need I be so forward with him that
     calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
     me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
     come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
     an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
     Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
     honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
     is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
     he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
     Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
     to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
     no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
     I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
     ends my catechism.
     Exit
**** SCENE II. The rebel camp. ****
     Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
EARL OF WORCESTER
     O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
     The liberal and kind offer of the king.
VERNON
     'Twere best he did.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     Then are we all undone.
     It is not possible, it cannot be,
     The king should keep his word in loving us;
     He will suspect us still and find a time
     To punish this offence in other faults:
     Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
     For treason is but trusted like the fox,
     Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
     Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
     Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
     Interpretation will misquote our looks,
     And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
     The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
     My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
     it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
     And an adopted name of privilege,
     A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
     All his offences live upon my head
     And on his father's; we did train him on,
     And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
     We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
     Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
     In any case, the offer of the king.
VERNON
     Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
     Here comes your cousin.
     Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
HOTSPUR
     My uncle is return'd:
     Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
     Uncle, what news?
EARL OF WORCESTER
     The king will bid you battle presently.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
HOTSPUR
     Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
     Exit
EARL OF WORCESTER
     There is no seeming mercy in the king.
HOTSPUR
     Did you beg any? God forbid!
EARL OF WORCESTER
     I told him gently of our grievances,
     Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
     By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
     He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
     With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
     Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
     A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
     And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
     Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
     And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
HOTSPUR
     O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
     And that no man might draw short breath today
     But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
     How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
VERNON
     No, by my soul; I never in my life
     Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
     Unless a brother should a brother dare
     To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
     He gave you all the duties of a man;
     Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
     Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
     Making you ever better than his praise
     By still dispraising praise valued in you;
     And, which became him like a prince indeed,
     He made a blushing cital of himself;
     And chid his truant youth with such a grace
     As if he master'd there a double spirit.
     Of teaching and of learning instantly.
     There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
     If he outlive the envy of this day,
     England did never owe so sweet a hope,
     So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
HOTSPUR
     Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
     On his follies: never did I hear
     Of any prince so wild a libertine.
     But be he as he will, yet once ere night
     I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
     That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
     Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
     Better consider what you have to do
     Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
     Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     My lord, here are letters for you.
HOTSPUR
     I cannot read them now.
     O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
     To spend that shortness basely were too long,
     If life did ride upon a dial's point,
     Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
     An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
     If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
     Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
     When the intent of bearing them is just.

     My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.
HOTSPUR
     I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
     For I profess not talking; only this--
     Let each man do his best: and here draw I
     A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
     With the best blood that I can meet withal
     In the adventure of this perilous day.
     Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
     Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
     And by that music let us all embrace;
     For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
     A second time do such a courtesy.
     The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt
**** SCENE III. Plain between the camps. ****
     KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter
     DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     What is thy name, that in the battle thus
     Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
     Upon my head?
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Know then, my name is Douglas;
     And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
     Because some tell me that thou art a king.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     They tell thee true.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
     Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
     This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
     Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
     I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
     And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
     Lord Stafford's death.
     They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
HOTSPUR
     O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
     never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.
HOTSPUR
     Where?
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Here.
HOTSPUR
     This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:
     A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
     Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
     A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
     Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
HOTSPUR
     The king hath many marching in his coats.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
     I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
     Until I meet the king.
HOTSPUR
     Up, and away!
     Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
     Exeunt
     Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus
FALSTAFF
     Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
     the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
     Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
     for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
     lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
     need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
     led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
     not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
     they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
     But who comes here?
     Enter PRINCE HENRY
PRINCE HENRY
     What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
     Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
     Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
     Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
     lend me thy sword.
FALSTAFF
     O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
     Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
     done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.
PRINCE HENRY
     He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,
     lend me thy sword.
FALSTAFF
     Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
     not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
PRINCE HENRY
     Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
FALSTAFF
     Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.
     PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack
PRINCE HENRY
     What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
     He throws the bottle at him. Exit
FALSTAFF
     Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
     come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
     willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
     not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
     life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
     unlooked for, and there's an end.
     Exit FALSTAFF
**** SCENE IV. Another part of the field. ****
     Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and
     EARL OF WESTMORELAND
KING HENRY IV
     I prithee,
     Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
     Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
LANCASTER
     Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
PRINCE HENRY
     I beseech your majesty, make up,
     Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
KING HENRY IV
     I will do so.
     My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
WESTMORELAND
     Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
PRINCE HENRY
     Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
     And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
     The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
     Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
     and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
LANCASTER
     We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
     Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.
     Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
PRINCE HENRY
     By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
     I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
     Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
     But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
KING HENRY IV
     I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
     With lustier maintenance than I did look for
     Of such an ungrown warrior.
PRINCE HENRY
     O, this boy
     Lends mettle to us all!
     Exit
     Enter DOUGLAS
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
     I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
     That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
     That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
KING HENRY IV
     The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
     So many of his shadows thou hast met
     And not the very king. I have two boys
     Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
     But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
     I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
     I fear thou art another counterfeit;
     And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
     But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
     And thus I win thee.
     They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters
PRINCE HENRY
     Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
     Never to hold it up again! the spirits
     Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
     It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
     Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
     They fight: DOUGLAS flies
     Cheerly, my lord how fares your grace?
     Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
     And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
KING HENRY IV
     Stay, and breathe awhile:
     Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
     And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
     In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
PRINCE HENRY
     O God! they did me too much injury
     That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
     If it were so, I might have let alone
     The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
     Which would have been as speedy in your end
     As all the poisonous potions in the world
     And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
KING HENRY IV
     Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
     Exit
     Enter HOTSPUR
HOTSPUR
     If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
PRINCE HENRY
     Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
HOTSPUR
     My name is Harry Percy.
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, then I see
     A very valiant rebel of the name.
     I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
     To share with me in glory any more:
     Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
     Nor can one England brook a double reign,
     Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
HOTSPUR
     Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
     To end the one of us; and would to God
     Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
PRINCE HENRY
     I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
     And all the budding honours on thy crest
     I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
HOTSPUR
     I can no longer brook thy vanities.
     They fight
     Enter FALSTAFF
FALSTAFF
     Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
     boy's play here, I can tell you.
     Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF, who falls down as if he
     were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls
HOTSPUR
     O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
     I better brook the loss of brittle life
     Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
     They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
     But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
     And time, that takes survey of all the world,
     Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
     But that the earthy and cold hand of death
     Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
     And food for--
     Dies
PRINCE HENRY
     For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
     Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
     When that this body did contain a spirit,
     A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
     But now two paces of the vilest earth
     Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
     Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
     If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
     I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
     But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
     And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
     For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
     Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
     Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
     But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
     He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
     What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
     Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
     I could have better spared a better man:
     O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
     If I were much in love with vanity!
     Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
     Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
     Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
     Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
     Exit PRINCE HENRY
FALSTAFF
     [Rising up] Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
     I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
     to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
     that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
     Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
     is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
     counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
     but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
     liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
     perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
     valour is discretion; in the which better part I
     have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
     gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
     should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
     afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
     Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
     killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
     Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
     Therefore, sirrah,
     Stabbing him
     with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
     Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
     Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
PRINCE HENRY
     Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
     Thy maiden sword.
LANCASTER
     But, soft! whom have we here?
     Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
PRINCE HENRY
     I did; I saw him dead,
     Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
     thou alive?
     Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
     I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
     Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
FALSTAFF
     No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
     be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
     Throwing the body down
     if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
     him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
     earl or duke, I can assure you.
PRINCE HENRY
     Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
FALSTAFF
     Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
     lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
     and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
     fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
     believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
     valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
     it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
     thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
     'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
LANCASTER
     This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
PRINCE HENRY
     This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
     Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
     For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
     I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
     A retreat is sounded
     The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
     Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
     To see what friends are living, who are dead.
     Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
FALSTAFF
     I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
     rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
     I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
     live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
     Exit
**** SCENE V. Another part of the field. ****
     The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN
     LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners
KING HENRY IV
     Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
     Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
     Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
     And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
     Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
     Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
     A noble earl and many a creature else
     Had been alive this hour,
     If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
     Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
EARL OF WORCESTER
     What I have done my safety urged me to;
     And I embrace this fortune patiently,
     Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
KING HENRY IV
     Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
     Other offenders we will pause upon.
     Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded
     How goes the field?
PRINCE HENRY
     The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
     The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
     The noble Percy slain, and all his men
     Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
     And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
     That the pursuers took him. At my tent
     The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
     I may dispose of him.
KING HENRY IV
     With all my heart.
PRINCE HENRY
     Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
     This honourable bounty shall belong:
     Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
     Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
     His valour shown upon our crests to-day
     Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
     Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
LANCASTER
     I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
     Which I shall give away immediately.
KING HENRY IV
     Then this remains, that we divide our power.
     You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
     Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
     To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
     Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
     Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
     To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
     Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
     Meeting the cheque of such another day:
     And since this business so fair is done,
     Let us not leave till all our own be won.
     Exeunt
The Third part of King Henry the Sixth
**** ACT I ****
**** SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house. ****
     Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and
     Soldiers
WARWICK
     I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
YORK
     While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
     He slily stole away and left his men:
     Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
     Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
     Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
     Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
     Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
     Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
EDWARD
     Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
     Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
     I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
     That this is true, father, behold his blood.
MONTAGUE
     And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
     Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
RICHARD
     Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
     Throwing down SOMERSET's head
YORK
     Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
     But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
NORFOLK
     Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
RICHARD
     Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
WARWICK
     And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
     Before I see thee seated in that throne
     Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
     I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
     This is the palace of the fearful king,
     And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
     For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
YORK
     Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
     For hither we have broken in by force.
NORFOLK
     We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
YORK
     Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
     And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
     They go up
WARWICK
     And when the king comes, offer no violence,
     Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
YORK
     The queen this day here holds her parliament,
     But little thinks we shall be of her council:
     By words or blows here let us win our right.
RICHARD
     Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
WARWICK
     The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
     Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
     And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
     Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
YORK
     Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
     I mean to take possession of my right.
WARWICK
     Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
     The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
     Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
     I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
     Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
     Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND,
     WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest
KING HENRY VI
     My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
     Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
     Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
     To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
     Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
     And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
     On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
CLIFFORD
     The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
WESTMORELAND
     What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
     My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
KING HENRY VI
     Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
CLIFFORD
     Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
     He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
     My gracious lord, here in the parliament
     Let us assail the family of York.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
KING HENRY VI
     Ah, know you not the city favours them,
     And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
EXETER
     But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
KING HENRY VI
     Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
     To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
     Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
     Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
     Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
     and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
     I am thy sovereign.
YORK
     I am thine.
EXETER
     For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
YORK
     'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
EXETER
     Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
WARWICK
     Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
     In following this usurping Henry.
CLIFFORD
     Whom should he follow but his natural king?
WARWICK
     True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
KING HENRY VI
     And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
YORK
     It must and shall be so: content thyself.
WARWICK
     Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
WESTMORELAND
     He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
     And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
WARWICK
     And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
     That we are those which chased you from the field
     And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
     March'd through the city to the palace gates.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
     And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
WESTMORELAND
     Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
     Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
     Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
CLIFFORD
     Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
     I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
     As shall revenge his death before I stir.
WARWICK
     Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
YORK
     Will you we show our title to the crown?
     If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
KING HENRY VI
     What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
     Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
     Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
     I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
     Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
     And seized upon their towns and provinces.
WARWICK
     Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
KING HENRY VI
     The lord protector lost it, and not I:
     When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
RICHARD
     You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
     Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
EDWARD
     Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
MONTAGUE
     Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
     Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
RICHARD
     Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
YORK
     Sons, peace!
KING HENRY VI
     Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
WARWICK
     Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
     And be you silent and attentive too,
     For he that interrupts him shall not live.
KING HENRY VI
     Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
     Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
     No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
     Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
     And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
     Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
     My title's good, and better far than his.
WARWICK
     Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
KING HENRY VI
     Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
YORK
     'Twas by rebellion against his king.
KING HENRY VI
     [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
     Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
YORK
     What then?
KING HENRY VI
     An if he may, then am I lawful king;
     For Richard, in the view of many lords,
     Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
     Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
YORK
     He rose against him, being his sovereign,
     And made him to resign his crown perforce.
WARWICK
     Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
     Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
EXETER
     No; for he could not so resign his crown
     But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
KING HENRY VI
     Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
EXETER
     His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
YORK
     Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
EXETER
     My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
KING HENRY VI
     [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
     Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
WARWICK
     Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
     Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
     Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
     Can set the duke up in despite of me.
CLIFFORD
     King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
     Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
     May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
     Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
KING HENRY VI
     O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
YORK
     Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
     What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
WARWICK
     Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
     Or I will fill the house with armed men,
     And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
     Write up his title with usurping blood.
     He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves
KING HENRY VI
     My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
     Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
YORK
     Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
     And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
KING HENRY VI
     I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
     Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
CLIFFORD
     What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
WARWICK
     What good is this to England and himself!
WESTMORELAND
     Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
CLIFFORD
     How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
WESTMORELAND
     I cannot stay to hear these articles.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Nor I.
CLIFFORD
     Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
WESTMORELAND
     Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
     In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
     And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
CLIFFORD
     In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
     Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
     Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND
WARWICK
     Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
EXETER
     They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
KING HENRY VI
     Ah, Exeter!
WARWICK
     Why should you sigh, my lord?
KING HENRY VI
     Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
     Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
     But be it as it may: I here entail
     The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
     Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
     To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
     To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
     And neither by treason nor hostility
     To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
YORK
     This oath I willingly take and will perform.
WARWICK
     Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
KING HENRY VI
     And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
YORK
     Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
EXETER
     Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
     Sennet. Here they come down
YORK
     Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
WARWICK
     And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
NORFOLK
     And I to Norfolk with my followers.
MONTAGUE
     And I unto the sea from whence I came.
     Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK,
     MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and Attendants
KING HENRY VI
     And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
     Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
EXETER
     Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
     I'll steal away.
KING HENRY VI
     Exeter, so will I.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
KING HENRY VI
     Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Who can be patient in such extremes?
     Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
     And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
     Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
     Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
     Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
     Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
     Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
     Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
     Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
     And disinherited thine only son.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Father, you cannot disinherit me:
     If you be king, why should not I succeed?
KING HENRY VI
     Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
     The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
     I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
     Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
     And given unto the house of York such head
     As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
     To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
     What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
     And creep into it far before thy time?
     Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
     Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
     The duke is made protector of the realm;
     And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
     The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
     Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
     The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
     Before I would have granted to that act.
     But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
     And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
     Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
     Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
     Whereby my son is disinherited.
     The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
     Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
     And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
     And utter ruin of the house of York.
     Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
     Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
KING HENRY VI
     Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
KING HENRY VI
     Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
PRINCE EDWARD
     When I return with victory from the field
     I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
     Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
KING HENRY VI
     Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
     Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
     Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
     Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
     Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
     Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
     The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
     I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
     Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.
EXETER
     And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Sandal Castle. ****
     Enter RICHARD, EDWARD, and MONTAGUE
RICHARD
     Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
EDWARD
     No, I can better play the orator.
MONTAGUE
     But I have reasons strong and forcible.
     Enter YORK
YORK
     Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
     What is your quarrel? how began it first?
EDWARD
     No quarrel, but a slight contention.
YORK
     About what?
RICHARD
     About that which concerns your grace and us;
     The crown of England, father, which is yours.
YORK
     Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
RICHARD
     Your right depends not on his life or death.
EDWARD
     Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
     By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
     It will outrun you, father, in the end.
YORK
     I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
EDWARD
     But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
     I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
RICHARD
     No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
YORK
     I shall be, if I claim by open war.
RICHARD
     I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
YORK
     Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
RICHARD
     An oath is of no moment, being not took
     Before a true and lawful magistrate,
     That hath authority over him that swears:
     Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
     Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
     Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
     Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
     How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
     Within whose circuit is Elysium
     And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
     Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
     Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
     Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
YORK
     Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
     Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
     And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
     Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
     And tell him privily of our intent.
     You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
     With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
     In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
     Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
     While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
     But that I seek occasion how to rise,
     And yet the king not privy to my drift,
     Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
     Enter a Messenger
     But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
Messenger
     The queen with all the northern earls and lords
     Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
     She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
     And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
YORK
     Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
     Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
     My brother Montague shall post to London:
     Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
     Whom we have left protectors of the king,
     With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
     And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
MONTAGUE
     Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
     And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
     Exit
     Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER
     Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
     You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
     The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
JOHN MORTIMER
     She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
YORK
     What, with five thousand men?
RICHARD
     Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
     A woman's general; what should we fear?
     A march afar off
EDWARD
     I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
     And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
YORK
     Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
     I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
     Many a battle have I won in France,
     When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
     Why should I not now have the like success?
     Alarum. Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield. ****
     Alarums. Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor
RUTLAND
     Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
     Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
     Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers
CLIFFORD
     Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
     As for the brat of this accursed duke,
     Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
Tutor
     And I, my lord, will bear him company.
CLIFFORD
     Soldiers, away with him!
Tutor
     Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
     Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
     Exit, dragged off by Soldiers
CLIFFORD
     How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
     That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
RUTLAND
     So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
     That trembles under his devouring paws;
     And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
     And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
     Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
     And not with such a cruel threatening look.
     Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
     I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
     Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
CLIFFORD
     In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
     Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
RUTLAND
     Then let my father's blood open it again:
     He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
CLIFFORD
     Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
     Were not revenge sufficient for me;
     No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
     And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
     It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
     The sight of any of the house of York
     Is as a fury to torment my soul;
     And till I root out their accursed line
     And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
     Therefore--
     Lifting his hand
RUTLAND
     O, let me pray before I take my death!
     To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!
CLIFFORD
     Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
RUTLAND
     I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
CLIFFORD
     Thy father hath.
RUTLAND
     But 'twas ere I was born.
     Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
     Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
     He be as miserably slain as I.
     Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
     And when I give occasion of offence,
     Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
CLIFFORD
     No cause!
     Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
     Stabs him
RUTLAND
     Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
     Dies
CLIFFORD
     Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
     And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
     Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
     Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
     Exit
**** SCENE IV. Another part of the field. ****
     Alarum. Enter YORK
YORK
     The army of the queen hath got the field:
     My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
     And all my followers to the eager foe
     Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
     Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
     My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
     But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
     Like men born to renown by life or death.
     Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
     And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
     And full as oft came Edward to my side,
     With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
     In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
     And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
     Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
     And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
     A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
     With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
     We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
     With bootless labour swim against the tide
     And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
     A short alarum within
     Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
     And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
     And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
     The sands are number'd that make up my life;
     Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
     Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and
     Soldiers
     Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
     I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
     I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
CLIFFORD
     Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
     With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
     Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
     And made an evening at the noontide prick.
YORK
     My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
     A bird that will revenge upon you all:
     And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
     Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
     Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?
CLIFFORD
     So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
     So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
     So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
     Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
YORK
     O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
     And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
     And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
     And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
     Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
CLIFFORD
     I will not bandy with thee word for word,
     But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
     I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
     Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
     To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
     What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
     For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
     When he might spurn him with his foot away?
     It is war's prize to take all vantages;
     And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
     They lay hands on YORK, who struggles
CLIFFORD
     Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     So doth the cony struggle in the net.
YORK
     So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
     So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     What would your grace have done unto him now?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
     Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
     That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
     Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
     What! was it you that would be England's king?
     Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
     And made a preachment of your high descent?
     Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
     The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
     And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
     Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
     Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
     Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
     Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
     That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
     Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
     And if thine eyes can water for his death,
     I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
     Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
     I should lament thy miserable state.
     I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
     What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
     That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
     Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
     And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
     Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
     Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
     York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
     A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
     Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
     Putting a paper crown on his head
     Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
     Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
     And this is he was his adopted heir.
     But how is it that great Plantagenet
     Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
     As I bethink me, you should not be king
     Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
     And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
     And rob his temples of the diadem,
     Now in his life, against your holy oath?
     O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
     Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
     And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
CLIFFORD
     That is my office, for my father's sake.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
YORK
     She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
     Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
     How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
     To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
     Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
     But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
     Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
     I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
     To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
     Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
     Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
     Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
     Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
     Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
     It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
     Unless the adage must be verified,
     That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
     'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
     But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
     'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
     The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
     'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
     The want thereof makes thee abominable:
     Thou art as opposite to every good
     As the Antipodes are unto us,
     Or as the south to the septentrion.
     O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
     How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
     To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
     And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
     Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
     Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
     Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
     Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
     For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
     And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
     These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
     And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
     'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
     Frenchwoman.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
     That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
YORK
     That face of his the hungry cannibals
     Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
     But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
     O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
     See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
     This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
     And I with tears do wash the blood away.
     Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
     And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
     Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
     Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
     And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
     There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
     And in thy need such comfort come to thee
     As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
     Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
     My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
     I should not for my life but weep with him.
     To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
QUEEN MARGARET
     What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
     Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
     And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
CLIFFORD
     Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
     Stabbing him
QUEEN MARGARET
     And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
     Stabbing him
YORK
     Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
     My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
     Dies
QUEEN MARGARET
     Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
     So York may overlook the town of York.

**** ACT II ****
**** SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire. ****
     A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
EDWARD
     I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
     Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
     From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
     Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
     Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
     Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
     The happy tidings of his good escape.
     How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
RICHARD
     I cannot joy, until I be resolved
     Where our right valiant father is become.
     I saw him in the battle range about;
     And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
     Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
     As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
     Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
     Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
     The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
     So fared our father with his enemies;
     So fled his enemies my warlike father:
     Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
     See how the morning opes her golden gates,
     And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
     How well resembles it the prime of youth,
     Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
EDWARD
     Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
RICHARD
     Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
     Not separated with the racking clouds,
     But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
     See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
     As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
     Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
     In this the heaven figures some event.
EDWARD
     'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
     I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
     That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
     Each one already blazing by our meeds,
     Should notwithstanding join our lights together
     And over-shine the earth as this the world.
     Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
     Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
RICHARD
     Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
     You love the breeder better than the male.
     Enter a Messenger
     But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
     Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
Messenger
     Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
     When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
     Your princely father and my loving lord!
EDWARD
     O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
RICHARD
     Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
Messenger
     Environed he was with many foes,
     And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
     Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
     But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
     And many strokes, though with a little axe,
     Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
     By many hands your father was subdued;
     But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
     Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
     Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
     Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
     The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
     A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
     Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
     And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
     They took his head, and on the gates of York
     They set the same; and there it doth remain,
     The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
EDWARD
     Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
     Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
     O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
     The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
     And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
     For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
     Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
     Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
     Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
     For never henceforth shall I joy again,
     Never, O never shall I see more joy!
RICHARD
     I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
     Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
     Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
     For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
     Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
     And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
     To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
     Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
     Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
     Or die renowned by attempting it.
EDWARD
     His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
     His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
RICHARD
     Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
     Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
     For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
     Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
     March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army
WARWICK
     How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
RICHARD
     Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
     Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
     Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
     The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
     O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
EDWARD
     O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
     Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
     Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
WARWICK
     Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
     And now, to add more measure to your woes,
     I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
     After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
     Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
     Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
     Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
     I, then in London keeper of the king,
     Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
     And very well appointed, as I thought,
     March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
     Bearing the king in my behalf along;
     For by my scouts I was advertised
     That she was coming with a full intent
     To dash our late decree in parliament
     Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
     Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
     Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
     But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
     Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
     That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
     Or whether 'twas report of her success;
     Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
     Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
     I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
     Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
     Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
     Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
     Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
     I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
     With promise of high pay and great rewards:
     But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
     And we in them no hope to win the day;
     So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
     Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
     In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
     For in the marches here we heard you were,
     Making another head to fight again.
EDWARD
     Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
     And when came George from Burgundy to England?
WARWICK
     Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
     And for your brother, he was lately sent
     From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
     With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
RICHARD
     'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
     Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
     But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
WARWICK
     Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
     For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
     Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
     And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
     Were he as famous and as bold in war
     As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
RICHARD
     I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
     'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
     But in this troublous time what's to be done?
     Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
     And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
     Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
     Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
     Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
     If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
WARWICK
     Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
     And therefore comes my brother Montague.
     Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
     With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
     And of their feather many more proud birds,
     Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
     He swore consent to your succession,
     His oath enrolled in the parliament;
     And now to London all the crew are gone,
     To frustrate both his oath and what beside
     May make against the house of Lancaster.
     Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
     Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
     With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
     Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
     Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
     Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
     And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
     And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
     But never once again turn back and fly.
RICHARD
     Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
     Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
     That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
EDWARD
     Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
     And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
     Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
WARWICK
     No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
     The next degree is England's royal throne;
     For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
     In every borough as we pass along;
     And he that throws not up his cap for joy
     Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
     King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
     Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
     But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
RICHARD
     Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
     As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
     I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.
EDWARD
     Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
     Enter a Messenger
WARWICK
     How now! what news?
Messenger
     The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
     The queen is coming with a puissant host;
     And craves your company for speedy counsel.
WARWICK
     Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. Before York. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD,
     CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets
QUEEN MARGARET
     Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
     Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
     That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
     Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
KING HENRY VI
     Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
     To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
     Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
     Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
CLIFFORD
     My gracious liege, this too much lenity
     And harmful pity must be laid aside.
     To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
     Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
     Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
     Not his that spoils her young before her face.
     Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
     Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
     The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
     And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
     Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
     Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
     He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
     And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
     Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
     Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
     Which argued thee a most unloving father.
     Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
     And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
     Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
     Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
     Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
     Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
     Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
     For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
     Were it not pity that this goodly boy
     Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
     And long hereafter say unto his child,
     'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
     My careless father fondly gave away'?
     Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
     And let his manly face, which promiseth
     Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
     To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
KING HENRY VI
     Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
     Inferring arguments of mighty force.
     But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
     That things ill-got had ever bad success?
     And happy always was it for that son
     Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
     I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
     And would my father had left me no more!
     For all the rest is held at such a rate
     As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
     Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
     Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
     How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
QUEEN MARGARET
     My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
     And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
     You promised knighthood to our forward son:
     Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
     Edward, kneel down.
KING HENRY VI
     Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
     And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
PRINCE
     My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
     I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
     And in that quarrel use it to the death.
CLIFFORD
     Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     Royal commanders, be in readiness:
     For with a band of thirty thousand men
     Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
     And in the towns, as they do march along,
     Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
     Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
CLIFFORD
     I would your highness would depart the field:
     The queen hath best success when you are absent.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     Be it with resolution then to fight.
PRINCE EDWARD
     My royal father, cheer these noble lords
     And hearten those that fight in your defence:
     Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
     March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and
     Soldiers
EDWARD
     Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
     And set thy diadem upon my head;
     Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
     Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
     Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
EDWARD
     I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
     I was adopted heir by his consent:
     Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
     You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
     Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
     To blot out me, and put his own son in.
CLIFFORD
     And reason too:
     Who should succeed the father but the son?
RICHARD
     Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
CLIFFORD
     Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
     Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
RICHARD
     'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
CLIFFORD
     Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
RICHARD
     For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
WARWICK
     What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
     When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
     Your legs did better service than your hands.
WARWICK
     Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
CLIFFORD
     You said so much before, and yet you fled.
WARWICK
     'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
NORTHUMBERLAND
     No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
RICHARD
     Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
     Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
     The execution of my big-swoln heart
     Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
CLIFFORD
     I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
RICHARD
     Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
     As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
     But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
KING HENRY VI
     Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
KING HENRY VI
     I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
     I am a king, and privileged to speak.
CLIFFORD
     My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
     Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
RICHARD
     Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
     By him that made us all, I am resolved
     that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
EDWARD
     Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
     A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
     That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
WARWICK
     If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
     For York in justice puts his armour on.
PRINCE EDWARD
     If that be right which Warwick says is right,
     There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
RICHARD
     Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
     For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
QUEEN MARGARET
     But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
     But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
     Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
     As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
RICHARD
     Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
     Whose father bears the title of a king,--
     As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
     Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
     To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
EDWARD
     A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
     To make this shameless callet know herself.
     Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
     Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
     And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
     By that false woman, as this king by thee.
     His father revell'd in the heart of France,
     And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
     And had he match'd according to his state,
     He might have kept that glory to this day;
     But when he took a beggar to his bed,
     And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
     Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
     That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
     And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
     For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
     Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
     And we, in pity of the gentle king,
     Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
GEORGE
     But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
     And that thy summer bred us no increase,
     We set the axe to thy usurping root;
     And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
     Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
     We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
     Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
EDWARD
     And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
     Not willing any longer conference,
     Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
     Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
     And either victory, or else a grave.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Stay, Edward.
EDWARD
     No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
     These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in ****
     Yorkshire.
     Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK
WARWICK
     Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
     I lay me down a little while to breathe;
     For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
     Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
     And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
     Enter EDWARD, running
EDWARD
     Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
     For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
WARWICK
     How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
     Enter GEORGE
GEORGE
     Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
     Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
     What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
EDWARD
     Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
     And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
     Enter RICHARD
RICHARD
     Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
     Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
     Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
     And in the very pangs of death he cried,
     Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
     'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
     So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
     That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
     The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
WARWICK
     Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
     I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
     Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
     Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
     And look upon, as if the tragedy
     Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
     Here on my knee I vow to God above,
     I'll never pause again, never stand still,
     Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
     Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
EDWARD
     O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
     And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
     And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
     I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
     Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
     Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
     That to my foes this body must be prey,
     Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
     And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
     Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
     Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.
RICHARD
     Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
     Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
     I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
     That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
WARWICK
     Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.
GEORGE
     Yet let us all together to our troops,
     And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
     And call them pillars that will stand to us;
     And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
     As victors wear at the Olympian games:
     This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
     For yet is hope of life and victory.
     Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Another part of the field. ****
     Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD
RICHARD
     Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
     Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
     And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
     Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.
CLIFFORD
     Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
     This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
     And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
     And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
     And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
     To execute the like upon thyself;
     And so, have at thee!
     They fight. WARWICK comes; CLIFFORD flies
RICHARD
     Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
     For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. Another part of the field. ****
     Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone
KING HENRY VI
     This battle fares like to the morning's war,
     When dying clouds contend with growing light,
     What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
     Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
     Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
     Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
     Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
     Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
     Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
     Now one the better, then another best;
     Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
     Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
     So is the equal of this fell war.
     Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
     To whom God will, there be the victory!
     For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
     Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
     They prosper best of all when I am thence.
     Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
     For what is in this world but grief and woe?
     O God! methinks it were a happy life,
     To be no better than a homely swain;
     To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
     To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
     Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
     How many make the hour full complete;
     How many hours bring about the day;
     How many days will finish up the year;
     How many years a mortal man may live.
     When this is known, then to divide the times:
     So many hours must I tend my flock;
     So many hours must I take my rest;
     So many hours must I contemplate;
     So many hours must I sport myself;
     So many days my ewes have been with young;
     So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
     So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
     So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
     Pass'd over to the end they were created,
     Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
     Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
     Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
     To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
     Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
     To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
     O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
     And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
     His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
     His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
     All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
     Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
     His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
     His body couched in a curious bed,
     When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.
     Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father, dragging in the dead
     body
Son
     Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
     This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
     May be possessed with some store of crowns;
     And I, that haply take them from him now,
     May yet ere night yield both my life and them
     To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
     Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
     Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
     O heavy times, begetting such events!
     From London by the king was I press'd forth;
     My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
     Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
     And I, who at his hands received my life, him
     Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
     Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
     And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
     My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
     And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
KING HENRY VI
     O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
     Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
     Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
     Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
     And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
     Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
     Enter a Father that has killed his son, bringing in the body
Father
     Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
     Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
     For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
     But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
     Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
     Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
     Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
     Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
     Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
     O, pity, God, this miserable age!
     What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
     Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
     This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
     O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
     And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
KING HENRY VI
     Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
     O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
     O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
     The red rose and the white are on his face,
     The fatal colours of our striving houses:
     The one his purple blood right well resembles;
     The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
     Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
     If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
Son
     How will my mother for a father's death
     Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
Father
     How will my wife for slaughter of my son
     Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
KING HENRY VI
     How will the country for these woful chances
     Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Son
     Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Father
     Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
KING HENRY VI
     Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
     Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
Son
     I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
     Exit with the body
Father
     These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
     My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
     For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
     My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
     And so obsequious will thy father be,
     Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
     As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
     I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
     For I have murdered where I should not kill.
     Exit with the body
KING HENRY VI
     Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
     Here sits a king more woful than you are.
     Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER
PRINCE EDWARD
     Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
     And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
     Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
     Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
     Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
     With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
     And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
     Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.
EXETER
     Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
     Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
     Or else come after: I'll away before.
KING HENRY VI
     Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
     Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
     Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. Another part of the field. ****
     A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
CLIFFORD
     Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
     Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
     O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
     More than my body's parting with my soul!
     My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
     And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
     Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
     The common people swarm like summer flies;
     And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
     And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
     O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
     That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
     Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
     And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
     Or as thy father and his father did,
     Giving no ground unto the house of York,
     They never then had sprung like summer flies;
     I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
     Had left no mourning widows for our death;
     And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
     For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
     And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
     Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
     No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
     The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
     For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
     The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
     And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
     Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
     I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.
     He faints
     Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK,
     and Soldiers
EDWARD
     Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
     And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
     Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
     That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
     As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
     Command an argosy to stem the waves.
     But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?
WARWICK
     No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
     For, though before his face I speak the words
     Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
     And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.
     CLIFFORD groans, and dies
EDWARD
     Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
RICHARD
     A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
EDWARD
     See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
     If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
RICHARD
     Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
     Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
     In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
     But set his murdering knife unto the root
     From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
     I mean our princely father, Duke of York.
WARWICK
     From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
     Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
     Instead whereof let this supply the room:
     Measure for measure must be answered.
EDWARD
     Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
     That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
     Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
     And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
WARWICK
     I think his understanding is bereft.
     Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
     Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
     And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
RICHARD
     O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
     'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
     Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
     Which in the time of death he gave our father.
GEORGE
     If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
RICHARD
     Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
EDWARD
     Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
WARWICK
     Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
GEORGE
     While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
RICHARD
     Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
EDWARD
     Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
GEORGE
     Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
WARWICK
     They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
RICHARD
     What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
     When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
     I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
     If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
     That I in all despite might rail at him,
     This hand should chop it off, and with the
     issuing blood
     Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
     York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
WARWICK
     Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
     And rear it in the place your father's stands.
     And now to London with triumphant march,
     There to be crowned England's royal king:
     From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
     And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
     So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
     And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
     The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
     For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
     Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
     First will I see the coronation;
     And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
     To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
EDWARD
     Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
     For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
     And never will I undertake the thing
     Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
     Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
     And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
     Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
RICHARD
     Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
     For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
WARWICK
     Tut, that's a foolish observation:
     Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
     To see these honours in possession.
     Exeunt
**** ACT III ****
**** SCENE I. A forest in the north of England. ****
     Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands
First Keeper
     Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
     For through this laund anon the deer will come;
     And in this covert will we make our stand,
     Culling the principal of all the deer.
Second Keeper
     I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
First Keeper
     That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
     Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
     Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
     And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
     I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
     In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
Second Keeper
     Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
     Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook
KING HENRY VI
     From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
     To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
     No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
     Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
     Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
     No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
     No humble suitors press to speak for right,
     No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
     For how can I help them, and not myself?
First Keeper
     Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
     This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
KING HENRY VI
     Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
     For wise men say it is the wisest course.
Second Keeper
     Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
First Keeper
     Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
KING HENRY VI
     My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
     And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
     Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
     To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
     Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
     For Warwick is a subtle orator,
     And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
     By this account then Margaret may win him;
     For she's a woman to be pitied much:
     Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
     Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
     The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
     And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
     To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
     Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
     She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
     He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
     She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
     He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
     That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
     Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
     Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
     And in conclusion wins the king from her,
     With promise of his sister, and what else,
     To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
     O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
     Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
Second Keeper
     Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
KING HENRY VI
     More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
     A man at least, for less I should not be;
     And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
Second Keeper
     Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
Second Keeper
     But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
KING HENRY VI
     My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
     Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
     Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
     A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
Second Keeper
     Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
     Your crown content and you must be contented
     To go along with us; for as we think,
     You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
     And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
     Will apprehend you as his enemy.
KING HENRY VI
     But did you never swear, and break an oath?
Second Keeper
     No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
KING HENRY VI
     Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Second Keeper
     Here in this country, where we now remain.
KING HENRY VI
     I was anointed king at nine months old;
     My father and my grandfather were kings,
     And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
     And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
First Keeper
     No;
     For we were subjects but while you were king.
KING HENRY VI
     Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
     Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
     Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
     And as the air blows it to me again,
     Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
     And yielding to another when it blows,
     Commanded always by the greater gust;
     Such is the lightness of you common men.
     But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
     My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
     Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
     And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
First Keeper
     We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
KING HENRY VI
     So would you be again to Henry,
     If he were seated as King Edward is.
First Keeper
     We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
     To go with us unto the officers.
KING HENRY VI
     In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
     And what God will, that let your king perform;
     And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. London. The palace. ****
     Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY
KING EDWARD IV
     Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
     This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
     His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
     Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
     Which we in justice cannot well deny,
     Because in quarrel of the house of York
     The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
GLOUCESTER
     Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
     It were dishonour to deny it her.
KING EDWARD IV
     It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
     I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
     Before the king will grant her humble suit.
CLARENCE
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game: how true
     he keeps the wind!
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
KING EDWARD IV
     Widow, we will consider of your suit;
     And come some other time to know our mind.
LADY GREY
     Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
     May it please your highness to resolve me now;
     And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] Ay, widow? then I'll warrant
     you all your lands,
     An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
     Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
CLARENCE
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she
     chance to fall.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
     take vantages.
KING EDWARD IV
     How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
CLARENCE
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a
     child of her.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, whip me then: he'll rather
     give her two.
LADY GREY
     Three, my most gracious lord.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] You shall have four, if you'll
     be ruled by him.
KING EDWARD IV
     'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
LADY GREY
     Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
KING EDWARD IV
     Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] Ay, good leave have you; for
     you will have leave,
     Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
     GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
KING EDWARD IV
     Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
LADY GREY
     Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
KING EDWARD IV
     And would you not do much to do them good?
LADY GREY
     To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
KING EDWARD IV
     Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
LADY GREY
     Therefore I came unto your majesty.
KING EDWARD IV
     I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
LADY GREY
     So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
KING EDWARD IV
     What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
LADY GREY
     What you command, that rests in me to do.
KING EDWARD IV
     But you will take exceptions to my boon.
LADY GREY
     No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
KING EDWARD IV
     Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
LADY GREY
     Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] He plies her hard; and much rain
     wears the marble.
CLARENCE
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] As red as fire! nay, then
     her wax must melt.
LADY GREY
     Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
KING EDWARD IV
     An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
LADY GREY
     That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
KING EDWARD IV
     Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
LADY GREY
     I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] The match is made; she seals it
     with a curtsy.
KING EDWARD IV
     But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
LADY GREY
     The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
KING EDWARD IV
     Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
     What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
LADY GREY
     My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
     That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
KING EDWARD IV
     No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
LADY GREY
     Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
KING EDWARD IV
     But now you partly may perceive my mind.
LADY GREY
     My mind will never grant what I perceive
     Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
KING EDWARD IV
     To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
LADY GREY
     To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
KING EDWARD IV
     Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
LADY GREY
     Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
     For by that loss I will not purchase them.
KING EDWARD IV
     Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
LADY GREY
     Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
     But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
     Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
     Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
KING EDWARD IV
     Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
     No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
LADY GREY
     Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] The widow likes him not, she
     knits her brows.
CLARENCE
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He is the bluntest wooer in
     Christendom.
KING EDWARD IV
     [Aside] Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
     Her words do show her wit incomparable;
     All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
     One way or other, she is for a king;
     And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
     Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
LADY GREY
     'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
     I am a subject fit to jest withal,
     But far unfit to be a sovereign.
KING EDWARD IV
     Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
     I speak no more than what my soul intends;
     And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
LADY GREY
     And that is more than I will yield unto:
     I know I am too mean to be your queen,
     And yet too good to be your concubine.
KING EDWARD IV
     You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
LADY GREY
     'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
KING EDWARD IV
     No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
     Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
     And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
     Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
     To be the father unto many sons.
     Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside to CLARENCE] The ghostly father now hath done
     his shrift.
CLARENCE
     [Aside to GLOUCESTER] When he was made a shriver,
     'twas for shift.
KING EDWARD IV
     Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
GLOUCESTER
     The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
KING EDWARD IV
     You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
CLARENCE
     To whom, my lord?
KING EDWARD IV
     Why, Clarence, to myself.
GLOUCESTER
     That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
CLARENCE
     That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
GLOUCESTER
     By so much is the wonder in extremes.
KING EDWARD IV
     Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
     Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
     Enter a Nobleman
Nobleman
     My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
     And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
KING EDWARD IV
     See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
     And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
     To question of his apprehension.
     Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
     Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
     Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
     That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
     To cross me from the golden time I look for!
     And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
     The lustful Edward's title buried--
     Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
     And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
     To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
     A cold premeditation for my purpose!
     Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
     Like one that stands upon a promontory,
     And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
     Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
     And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
     Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
     So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
     And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
     And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
     Flattering me with impossibilities.
     My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
     Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
     Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
     What other pleasure can the world afford?
     I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
     And deck my body in gay ornaments,
     And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
     O miserable thought! and more unlikely
     Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
     Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
     And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
     She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
     To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
     To make an envious mountain on my back,
     Where sits deformity to mock my body;
     To shape my legs of an unequal size;
     To disproportion me in every part,
     Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
     That carries no impression like the dam.
     And am I then a man to be beloved?
     O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
     Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
     But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
     As are of better person than myself,
     I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
     And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
     Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
     Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
     And yet I know not how to get the crown,
     For many lives stand between me and home:
     And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
     That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
     Seeking a way and straying from the way;
     Not knowing how to find the open air,
     But toiling desperately to find it out,--
     Torment myself to catch the English crown:
     And from that torment I will free myself,
     Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
     Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
     And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
     And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
     And frame my face to all occasions.
     I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
     I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
     I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
     Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
     And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
     I can add colours to the chameleon,
     Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
     And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
     Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
     Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

**** SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA, his Admiral, called
     BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI
     sits, and riseth up again
KING LEWIS XI
     Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
     Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
     And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
QUEEN MARGARET
     No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
     Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
     Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
     Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
     But now mischance hath trod my title down,
     And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
     Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
     And to my humble seat conform myself.
KING LEWIS XI
     Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
QUEEN MARGARET
     From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
     And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
KING LEWIS XI
     Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
     And sit thee by our side:
     Seats her by him
     Yield not thy neck
     To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
     Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
     Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
     It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
     And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
     Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
     That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
     Is of a king become a banish'd man,
     And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
     While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
     Usurps the regal title and the seat
     Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
     This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
     With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
     Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
     And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
     Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
     Our people and our peers are both misled,
     Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
     And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
KING LEWIS XI
     Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
     While we bethink a means to break it off.
QUEEN MARGARET
     The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
KING LEWIS XI
     The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
QUEEN MARGARET
     O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
     And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
     Enter WARWICK
KING LEWIS XI
     What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
KING LEWIS XI
     Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
     He descends. She ariseth
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
     For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
WARWICK
     From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
     My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
     I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
     First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
     And then to crave a league of amity;
     And lastly, to confirm that amity
     With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
     That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
     To England's king in lawful marriage.
QUEEN MARGARET
     [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
WARWICK
     [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
     I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
     Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
     To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
     Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
     Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
QUEEN MARGARET
     King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
     Before you answer Warwick. His demand
     Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
     But from deceit bred by necessity;
     For how can tyrants safely govern home,
     Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
     To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
     That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
     Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
     Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
     Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
     For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
     Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
WARWICK
     Injurious Margaret!
PRINCE EDWARD
     And why not queen?
WARWICK
     Because thy father Henry did usurp;
     And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
OXFORD
     Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
     Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
     And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
     Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
     And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
     Who by his prowess conquered all France:
     From these our Henry lineally descends.
WARWICK
     Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
     You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
     All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
     Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
     But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
     Of threescore and two years; a silly time
     To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
OXFORD
     Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
     Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
     And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
WARWICK
     Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
     Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
     For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
OXFORD
     Call him my king by whose injurious doom
     My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
     Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
     Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
     When nature brought him to the door of death?
     No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
     This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
WARWICK
     And I the house of York.
KING LEWIS XI
     Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
     Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
     While I use further conference with Warwick.
     They stand aloof
QUEEN MARGARET
     Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
KING LEWIS XI
     Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
     Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
     To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
WARWICK
     Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
KING LEWIS XI
     But is he gracious in the people's eye?
WARWICK
     The more that Henry was unfortunate.
KING LEWIS XI
     Then further, all dissembling set aside,
     Tell me for truth the measure of his love
     Unto our sister Bona.
WARWICK
     Such it seems
     As may beseem a monarch like himself.
     Myself have often heard him say and swear
     That this his love was an eternal plant,
     Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
     The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
     Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
     Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
KING LEWIS XI
     Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
BONA
     Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
     To WARWICK
     Yet I confess that often ere this day,
     When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
     Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
KING LEWIS XI
     Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
     And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
     Touching the jointure that your king must make,
     Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
     Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
     That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
PRINCE EDWARD
     To Edward, but not to the English king.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
     By this alliance to make void my suit:
     Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
KING LEWIS XI
     And still is friend to him and Margaret:
     But if your title to the crown be weak,
     As may appear by Edward's good success,
     Then 'tis but reason that I be released
     From giving aid which late I promised.
     Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
     That your estate requires and mine can yield.
WARWICK
     Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
     Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
     And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
     You have a father able to maintain you;
     And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
     Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
     I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
     Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
     Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
     For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
     Post blows a horn within
KING LEWIS XI
     Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
     Enter a Post
Post
     [To WARWICK] My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
     Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:
     To KING LEWIS XI
     These from our king unto your majesty:
     To QUEEN MARGARET
     And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.
     They all read their letters
OXFORD
     I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
     Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
     I hope all's for the best.
KING LEWIS XI
     Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
WARWICK
     Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
KING LEWIS XI
     What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
     And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
     Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
     Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
     Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
QUEEN MARGARET
     I told your majesty as much before:
     This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
WARWICK
     King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
     And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
     That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
     No more my king, for he dishonours me,
     But most himself, if he could see his shame.
     Did I forget that by the house of York
     My father came untimely to his death?
     Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
     Did I impale him with the regal crown?
     Did I put Henry from his native right?
     And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
     Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
     And to repair my honour lost for him,
     I here renounce him and return to Henry.
     My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
     And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
     I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
     And replant Henry in his former state.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
     And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
     And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
WARWICK
     So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
     That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
     With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
     I'll undertake to land them on our coast
     And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
     'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
     And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
     He's very likely now to fall from him,
     For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
     Or than for strength and safety of our country.
BONA
     Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
     But by thy help to this distressed queen?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
     Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
BONA
     My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
WARWICK
     And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
KING LEWIS XI
     And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
     Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
     You shall have aid.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
KING LEWIS XI
     Then, England's messenger, return in post,
     And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
     That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
     To revel it with him and his new bride:
     Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
BONA
     Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
     I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
     And I am ready to put armour on.
WARWICK
     Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
     And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
     There's thy reward: be gone.
     Exit Post
KING LEWIS XI
     But, Warwick,
     Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
     Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
     And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
     And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
     Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
     What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
WARWICK
     This shall assure my constant loyalty,
     That if our queen and this young prince agree,
     I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
     To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
     Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
     Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
     And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
     That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
     And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
     He gives his hand to WARWICK
KING LEWIS XI
     Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
     And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
     Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
     I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
     For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
     Exeunt all but WARWICK
WARWICK
     I came from Edward as ambassador,
     But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
     Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
     But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
     Had he none else to make a stale but me?
     Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
     I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
     And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
     Not that I pity Henry's misery,
     But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.

**** ACT IV ****
**** SCENE I. London. The palace. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE
GLOUCESTER
     Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
     Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
     Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
CLARENCE
     Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
     How could he stay till Warwick made return?
SOMERSET
     My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
GLOUCESTER
     And his well-chosen bride.
CLARENCE
     I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
     Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended; QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE,
     STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others
KING EDWARD IV
     Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
     That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
CLARENCE
     As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
     Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
     That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
KING EDWARD IV
     Suppose they take offence without a cause,
     They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
     Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
GLOUCESTER
     And shall have your will, because our king:
     Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
KING EDWARD IV
     Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
GLOUCESTER
     Not I:
     No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
     Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
     To sunder them that yoke so well together.
KING EDWARD IV
     Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
     Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
     Should not become my wife and England's queen.
     And you too, Somerset and Montague,
     Speak freely what you think.
CLARENCE
     Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
     Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
     About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
GLOUCESTER
     And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
     Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
KING EDWARD IV
     What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
     By such invention as I can devise?
MONTAGUE
     Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
     Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
     'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
HASTINGS
     Why, knows not Montague that of itself
     England is safe, if true within itself?
MONTAGUE
     But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
HASTINGS
     'Tis better using France than trusting France:
     Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
     Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
     And with their helps only defend ourselves;
     In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
CLARENCE
     For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
     To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
KING EDWARD IV
     Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
     And for this once my will shall stand for law.
GLOUCESTER
     And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
     To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
     Unto the brother of your loving bride;
     She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
     But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
CLARENCE
     Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
     Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
     And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
KING EDWARD IV
     Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
     That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
CLARENCE
     In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
     Which being shallow, you give me leave
     To play the broker in mine own behalf;
     And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
KING EDWARD IV
     Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
     And not be tied unto his brother's will.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     My lords, before it pleased his majesty
     To raise my state to title of a queen,
     Do me but right, and you must all confess
     That I was not ignoble of descent;
     And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
     But as this title honours me and mine,
     So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
     Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
KING EDWARD IV
     My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
     What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
     So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
     And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
     Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
     Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
     Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
     And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
     Enter a Post
KING EDWARD IV
     Now, messenger, what letters or what news
     From France?
Post
     My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
     But such as I, without your special pardon,
     Dare not relate.
KING EDWARD IV
     Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
     Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
     What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
Post
     At my depart, these were his very words:
     'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
     That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
     To revel it with him and his new bride.'
KING EDWARD IV
     Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
     But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
Post
     These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
     'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
     I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
KING EDWARD IV
     I blame not her, she could say little less;
     She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
     For I have heard that she was there in place.
Post
     'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
     And I am ready to put armour on.'
KING EDWARD IV
     Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
     But what said Warwick to these injuries?
Post
     He, more incensed against your majesty
     Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
     'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
     And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
KING EDWARD IV
     Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
     Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
     They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
     But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
Post
     Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
     friendship
     That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
CLARENCE
     Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
     Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
     For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
     That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
     I may not prove inferior to yourself.
     You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
     Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] Not I:
     My thoughts aim at a further matter; I
     Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.
KING EDWARD IV
     Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
     Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
     And haste is needful in this desperate case.
     Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
     Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
     They are already, or quickly will be landed:
     Myself in person will straight follow you.
     Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
     But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
     Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
     Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
     Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
     If it be so, then both depart to him;
     I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
     But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
     Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
     That I may never have you in suspect.
MONTAGUE
     So God help Montague as he proves true!
HASTINGS
     And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
KING EDWARD IV
     Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
KING EDWARD IV
     Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
     Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
     Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE II. A plain in Warwickshire. ****
     Enter WARWICK and OXFORD, with French soldiers
WARWICK
     Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
     The common people by numbers swarm to us.
     Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
     But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
     Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
CLARENCE
     Fear not that, my lord.
WARWICK
     Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
     And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
     To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
     Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
     Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
     Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
     But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
     And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
     Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
     His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
     And but attended by a simple guard,
     We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
     Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
     That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
     With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
     And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
     So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
     At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
     And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
     For I intend but only to surprise him.
     You that will follow me to this attempt,
     Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
     They all cry, 'Henry!'
     Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
     For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
     Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Edward's camp, near Warwick. ****
     Enter three Watchmen, to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent
First Watchman
     Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
     The king by this is set him down to sleep.
Second Watchman
     What, will he not to bed?
First Watchman
     Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
     Never to lie and take his natural rest
     Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
Second Watchman
     To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
     If Warwick be so near as men report.
Third Watchman
     But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
     That with the king here resteth in his tent?
First Watchman
     'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
Third Watchman
     O, is it so? But why commands the king
     That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
     While he himself keeps in the cold field?
Second Watchman
     'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
Third Watchman
     Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
     I like it better than a dangerous honour.
     If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
     'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
First Watchman
     Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Second Watchman
     Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
     But to defend his person from night-foes?
     Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and French soldiers,
     silent all
WARWICK
     This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
     Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
     But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
First Watchman
     Who goes there?
Second Watchman
     Stay, or thou diest!
     WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!' and set upon the
     Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following
     them
     The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter WARWICK, SOMERSET, and
     the rest, bringing KING EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a
     chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage
SOMERSET
     What are they that fly there?
WARWICK
     Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
KING EDWARD IV
     The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
     Thou call'dst me king.
WARWICK
     Ay, but the case is alter'd:
     When you disgraced me in my embassade,
     Then I degraded you from being king,
     And come now to create you Duke of York.
     Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
     That know not how to use ambassadors,
     Nor how to be contented with one wife,
     Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
     Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
     Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
KING EDWARD IV
     Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
     Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
     Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
     Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
     Edward will always bear himself as king:
     Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
     My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
WARWICK
     Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
     Takes off his crown
     But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
     And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
     My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
     See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
     Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
     When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
     I'll follow you, and tell what answer
     Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
     Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
     They lead him out forcibly
KING EDWARD IV
     What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
     It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
     Exit, guarded
OXFORD
     What now remains, my lords, for us to do
     But march to London with our soldiers?
WARWICK
     Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
     To free King Henry from imprisonment
     And see him seated in the regal throne.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. London. The palace. ****
     Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS
RIVERS
     Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
     What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
RIVERS
     What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     No, but the loss of his own royal person.
RIVERS
     Then is my sovereign slain?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
     Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
     Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
     And, as I further have to understand,
     Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
     Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
RIVERS
     These news I must confess are full of grief;
     Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
     Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
     And I the rather wean me from despair
     For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
     This is it that makes me bridle passion
     And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
     Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
     And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
     Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
     King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.
RIVERS
     But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
     To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
     Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
     But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
     For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
     I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
     To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
     There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
     Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
     If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire. ****
     Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and STANLEY
GLOUCESTER
     Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
     Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
     Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
     Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
     Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
     He hath good usage and great liberty,
     And, often but attended with weak guard,
     Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
     I have advertised him by secret means
     That if about this hour he make his way
     Under the colour of his usual game,
     He shall here find his friends with horse and men
     To set him free from his captivity.
     Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him
Huntsman
     This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
KING EDWARD IV
     Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
     Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
     Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
GLOUCESTER
     Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
     Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
KING EDWARD IV
     But whither shall we then?
HASTINGS
     To Lynn, my lord,
     And ship from thence to Flanders.
GLOUCESTER
     Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
KING EDWARD IV
     Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
GLOUCESTER
     But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
KING EDWARD IV
     Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
Huntsman
     Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
GLOUCESTER
     Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
KING EDWARD IV
     Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
     And pray that I may repossess the crown.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. London. The Tower. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, HENRY OF
     RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and Lieutenant of the Tower
KING HENRY VI
     Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
     Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
     And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
     My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
     At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
Lieutenant
     Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
     But if an humble prayer may prevail,
     I then crave pardon of your majesty.
KING HENRY VI
     For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
     Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
     For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
     Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
     Conceive when after many moody thoughts
     At last by notes of household harmony
     They quite forget their loss of liberty.
     But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
     And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
     He was the author, thou the instrument.
     Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
     By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
     And that the people of this blessed land
     May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
     Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
     I here resign my government to thee,
     For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
WARWICK
     Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
     And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
     By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
     For few men rightly temper with the stars:
     Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
     For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
CLARENCE
     No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
     To whom the heavens in thy nativity
     Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
     As likely to be blest in peace and war;
     And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
WARWICK
     And I choose Clarence only for protector.
KING HENRY VI
     Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
     Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
     That no dissension hinder government:
     I make you both protectors of this land,
     While I myself will lead a private life
     And in devotion spend my latter days,
     To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
WARWICK
     What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
CLARENCE
     That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
     For on thy fortune I repose myself.
WARWICK
     Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
     We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
     To Henry's body, and supply his place;
     I mean, in bearing weight of government,
     While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
     And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
     Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
     And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
CLARENCE
     What else? and that succession be determined.
WARWICK
     Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
KING HENRY VI
     But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
     Let me entreat, for I command no more,
     That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
     Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
     For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
     My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
CLARENCE
     It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
KING HENRY VI
     My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
     Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
SOMERSET
     My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
KING HENRY VI
     Come hither, England's hope.
     Lays his hand on his head
     If secret powers
     Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
     This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
     His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
     His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
     His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
     Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
     Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
     Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
     Enter a Post
WARWICK
     What news, my friend?
Post
     That Edward is escaped from your brother,
     And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
WARWICK
     Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
Post
     He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
     And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
     In secret ambush on the forest side
     And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
     For hunting was his daily exercise.
WARWICK
     My brother was too careless of his charge.
     But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
     A salve for any sore that may betide.
     Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD
SOMERSET
     My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
     For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
     And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
     As Henry's late presaging prophecy
     Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
     So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
     What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
     Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
     Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
     Till storms be past of civil enmity.
OXFORD
     Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
     'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
SOMERSET
     It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
     Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VII. Before York. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and Soldiers
KING EDWARD IV
     Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
     Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
     And says that once more I shall interchange
     My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
     Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
     And brought desired help from Burgundy:
     What then remains, we being thus arrived
     From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
     But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
GLOUCESTER
     The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
     For many men that stumble at the threshold
     Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
KING EDWARD IV
     Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
     By fair or foul means we must enter in,
     For hither will our friends repair to us.
HASTINGS
     My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
     Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren
Mayor
     My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
     And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
     For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
KING EDWARD IV
     But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
     Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
Mayor
     True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
KING EDWARD IV
     Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
     As being well content with that alone.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
     He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
HASTINGS
     Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
     Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
Mayor
     Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
     They descend
GLOUCESTER
     A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
HASTINGS
     The good old man would fain that all were well,
     So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
     I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
     Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
     Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below
KING EDWARD IV
     So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
     But in the night or in the time of war.
     What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
     Takes his keys
     For Edward will defend the town and thee,
     And all those friends that deign to follow me.
     March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers
GLOUCESTER
     Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
     Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
KING EDWARD IV
     Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
MONTAGUE
     To help King Edward in his time of storm,
     As every loyal subject ought to do.
KING EDWARD IV
     Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
     Our title to the crown and only claim
     Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
MONTAGUE
     Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
     I came to serve a king and not a duke.
     Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
     The drum begins to march
KING EDWARD IV
     Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate
     By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
MONTAGUE
     What talk you of debating? in few words,
     If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
     I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
     To keep them back that come to succor you:
     Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
GLOUCESTER
     Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
KING EDWARD IV
     When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
     Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
HASTINGS
     Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
GLOUCESTER
     And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
     Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
     The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
KING EDWARD IV
     Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
     And Henry but usurps the diadem.
MONTAGUE
     Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
     And now will I be Edward's champion.
HASTINGS
     Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
     Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.
     Flourish
Soldier
     Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
     England and France, and lord of Ireland, & c.
MONTAGUE
     And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
     By this I challenge him to single fight.
     Throws down his gauntlet
All
     Long live Edward the Fourth!
KING EDWARD IV
     Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
     If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
     Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
     And when the morning sun shall raise his car
     Above the border of this horizon,
     We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
     For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
     Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
     To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
     Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
     Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
     And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VIII. London. The palace. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, WARWICK, MONTAGUE, CLARENCE, EXETER,
     and OXFORD
WARWICK
     What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
     With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
     Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
     And with his troops doth march amain to London;
     And many giddy people flock to him.
KING HENRY VI
     Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
CLARENCE
     A little fire is quickly trodden out;
     Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
WARWICK
     In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
     Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
     Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
     Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
     The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
     Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
     Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
     Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
     And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
     In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
     My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
     Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
     Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
     Shall rest in London till we come to him.
     Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
     Farewell, my sovereign.
KING HENRY VI
     Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
CLARENCE
     In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
KING HENRY VI
     Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
MONTAGUE
     Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
OXFORD
     And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
KING HENRY VI
     Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
     And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
WARWICK
     Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
     Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER
KING HENRY VI
     Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
     Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
     Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
     Should not be able to encounter mine.
EXETER
     The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
KING HENRY VI
     That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
     I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
     Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
     My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
     My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
     My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
     I have not been desirous of their wealth,
     Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
     Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
     Then why should they love Edward more than me?
     No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
     And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
     The lamb will never cease to follow him.
     Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'
EXETER
     Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
     Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers
KING EDWARD IV
     Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
     And once again proclaim us King of England.
     You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
     Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
     And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
     Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
     Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI
     And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
     Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
     The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
     Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
GLOUCESTER
     Away betimes, before his forces join,
     And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
     Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
     Exeunt
**** ACT V ****
**** SCENE I. Coventry. ****
     Enter WARWICK, the Mayor of Coventry, two Messengers, and others upon
     the walls
WARWICK
     Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
     How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
First Messenger
     By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
WARWICK
     How far off is our brother Montague?
     Where is the post that came from Montague?
Second Messenger
     By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
     Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE
WARWICK
     Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
     And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
SOMERSET
     At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
     And do expect him here some two hours hence.
     Drum heard
WARWICK
     Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
SOMERSET
     It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
     The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
WARWICK
     Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
SOMERSET
     They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
     March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers
KING EDWARD IV
     Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
GLOUCESTER
     See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
WARWICK
     O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
     Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
     That we could hear no news of his repair?
KING EDWARD IV
     Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
     Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
     Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
     And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
WARWICK
     Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
     Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
     Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
     And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
GLOUCESTER
     I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
     Or did he make the jest against his will?
WARWICK
     Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
GLOUCESTER
     Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
     I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
WARWICK
     'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
KING EDWARD IV
     Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
WARWICK
     Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
     And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
     And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
KING EDWARD IV
     But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
     And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
     What is the body when the head is off?
GLOUCESTER
     Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
     But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
     The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
     You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
     And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.
EDWARD
     'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
GLOUCESTER
     Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
     Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
WARWICK
     I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
     And with the other fling it at thy face,
     Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
KING EDWARD IV
     Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
     This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
     Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
     Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
     'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
     Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours
WARWICK
     O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
OXFORD
     Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
     He and his forces enter the city
GLOUCESTER
     The gates are open, let us enter too.
KING EDWARD IV
     So other foes may set upon our backs.
     Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
     Will issue out again and bid us battle:
     If not, the city being but of small defence,
     We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
WARWICK
     O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
     Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
MONTAGUE
     Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
     He and his forces enter the city
GLOUCESTER
     Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
     Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
KING EDWARD IV
     The harder match'd, the greater victory:
     My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
     Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours
SOMERSET
     Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
     He and his forces enter the city
GLOUCESTER
     Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
     Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
     And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
     Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours
WARWICK
     And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
     Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
     With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
     More than the nature of a brother's love!
     Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
CLARENCE
     Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
     Taking his red rose out of his hat
     Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
     I will not ruinate my father's house,
     Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
     And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
     That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
     To bend the fatal instruments of war
     Against his brother and his lawful king?
     Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
     To keep that oath were more impiety
     Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
     I am so sorry for my trespass made
     That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
     I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
     With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
     As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
     To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
     And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
     And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
     Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
     And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
     For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
KING EDWARD IV
     Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
     Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
GLOUCESTER
     Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
WARWICK
     O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
KING EDWARD IV
     What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
     Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
WARWICK
     Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
     I will away towards Barnet presently,
     And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
KING EDWARD IV
     Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
     Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
     Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company
     follow
**** SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet. ****
     Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing forth WARWICK
     wounded
KING EDWARD IV
     So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
     For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
     Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
     That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
     Exit
WARWICK
     Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
     And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
     Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
     My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
     That I must yield my body to the earth
     And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
     Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
     Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
     Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
     Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
     And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
     These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
     Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
     To search the secret treasons of the world:
     The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
     Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
     For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
     And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
     Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
     My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
     Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
     Is nothing left me but my body's length.
     Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
     And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
     Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
SOMERSET
     Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
     We might recover all our loss again;
     The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
     Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!
WARWICK
     Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
     If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
     And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
     Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
     Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
     That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
     Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
SOMERSET
     Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
     And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
     And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
     And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
     Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
     That mought not be distinguished; but at last
     I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
     'O, farewell, Warwick!'
WARWICK
     Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
     For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
     Dies
OXFORD
     Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
     Here they bear away his body. Exeunt
**** SCENE III. Another part of the field. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE,
     and the rest
KING EDWARD IV
     Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
     And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
     But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
     I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
     That will encounter with our glorious sun,
     Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
     I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
     Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
     And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
CLARENCE
     A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
     And blow it to the source from whence it came:
     The very beams will dry those vapours up,
     For every cloud engenders not a storm.
GLOUCESTER
     The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
     And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:
     If she have time to breathe be well assured
     Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
KING EDWARD IV
     We are advertised by our loving friends
     That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
     We, having now the best at Barnet field,
     Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
     And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
     In every county as we go along.
     Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE IV. Plains near Tewksbury. ****
     March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and
     soldiers
QUEEN MARGARET
     Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
     But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
     What though the mast be now blown overboard,
     The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
     And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
     Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
     Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
     With tearful eyes add water to the sea
     And give more strength to that which hath too much,
     Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
     Which industry and courage might have saved?
     Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
     Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
     And Montague our topmost; what of him?
     Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
     Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
     And Somerset another goodly mast?
     The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
     And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
     For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
     We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
     But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
     From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
     As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
     And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
     What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
     And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
     All these the enemies to our poor bark.
     Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
     Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
     Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
     Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
     This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
     If case some one of you would fly from us,
     That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
     More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
     Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
     'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
     Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
     Infuse his breast with magnanimity
     And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
     I speak not this as doubting any here
     For did I but suspect a fearful man
     He should have leave to go away betimes,
     Lest in our need he might infect another
     And make him of like spirit to himself.
     If any such be here--as God forbid!--
     Let him depart before we need his help.
OXFORD
     Women and children of so high a courage,
     And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
     O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
     Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
     To bear his image and renew his glories!
SOMERSET
     And he that will not fight for such a hope.
     Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
     If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
PRINCE EDWARD
     And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
     Enter a Messenger
Messenger
     Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
     Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.
OXFORD
     I thought no less: it is his policy
     To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
SOMERSET
     But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
QUEEN MARGARET
     This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
OXFORD
     Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
     Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and
     soldiers
KING EDWARD IV
     Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
     Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
     Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
     I need not add more fuel to your fire,
     For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
     Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
QUEEN MARGARET
     Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
     My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
     Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
     Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
     Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
     His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
     His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
     And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
     You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
     Be valiant and give signal to the fight.

KING EDWARD IV
     Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
     Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
     For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
     Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.
OXFORD
     For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
SOMERSET
     Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
     Exeunt Oxford and Somerset, guarded
QUEEN MARGARET
     So part we sadly in this troublous world,
     To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
KING EDWARD IV
     Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
     Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
GLOUCESTER
     It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
     Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD
KING EDWARD IV
     Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
     What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
     Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
     For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
     And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
PRINCE EDWARD
     Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
     Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
     Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
     Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
     Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
GLOUCESTER
     That you might still have worn the petticoat,
     And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
     His currish riddles sort not with this place.
GLOUCESTER
     By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
GLOUCESTER
     For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
PRINCE EDWARD
     Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
KING EDWARD IV
     Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
CLARENCE
     Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
PRINCE EDWARD
     I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
     Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
     And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
     I am your better, traitors as ye are:
     And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
KING EDWARD IV
     Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
     Stabs him
GLOUCESTER
     Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.
     Stabs him
CLARENCE
     And there's for twitting me with perjury.
     Stabs him
QUEEN MARGARET
     O, kill me too!
GLOUCESTER
     Marry, and shall.
     Offers to kill her
KING EDWARD IV
     Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.
GLOUCESTER
     Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
KING EDWARD IV
     What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
GLOUCESTER
     Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
     I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
     Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
CLARENCE
     What? what?
GLOUCESTER
     The Tower, the Tower.
     Exit
QUEEN MARGARET
     O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
     Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
     They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
     Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
     If this foul deed were by to equal it:
     He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
     And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
     What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
     No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
     And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
     Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
     How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
     You have no children, butchers! if you had,
     The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
     But if you ever chance to have a child,
     Look in his youth to have him so cut off
     As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
KING EDWARD IV
     Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
     Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:
     What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.
CLARENCE
     By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
QUEEN MARGARET
     Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
CLARENCE
     Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
QUEEN MARGARET
     Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
     'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
     What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
     Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
     Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
     Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
KING EDWARD IV
     Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.
QUEEN MARGARET
     So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
     Exit, led out forcibly
KING EDWARD IV
     Where's Richard gone?
CLARENCE
     To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
     To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
KING EDWARD IV
     He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
     Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
     With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
     And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
     By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
     Exeunt
**** SCENE VI. London. The Tower. ****
     Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER, with the Lieutenant, on the walls
GLOUCESTER
     Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
KING HENRY VI
     Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
     'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
     'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
     And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'
GLOUCESTER
     Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
     Exit Lieutenant
KING HENRY VI
     So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
     So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
     And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
     What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
GLOUCESTER
     Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
     The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
KING HENRY VI
     The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
     With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
     And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
     Have now the fatal object in my eye
     Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.
GLOUCESTER
     Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
     That taught his son the office of a fowl!
     An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
KING HENRY VI
     I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
     Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
     The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
     Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
     Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
     Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
     My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
     Than can my ears that tragic history.
     But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
GLOUCESTER
     Think'st thou I am an executioner?
KING HENRY VI
     A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
     If murdering innocents be executing,
     Why, then thou art an executioner.
GLOUCESTER
     Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
KING HENRY VI
     Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
     Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
     And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
     Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
     And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
     And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
     Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
     And orphans for their parents timeless death--
     Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
     The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
     The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
     Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
     The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
     And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
     Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
     And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
     To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
     Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
     Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
     To signify thou camest to bite the world:
     And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
     Thou camest--
GLOUCESTER
     I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
     Stabs him
     For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.
KING HENRY VI
     Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
     God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!
     Dies
GLOUCESTER
     What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
     Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
     See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
     O, may such purple tears be alway shed
     From those that wish the downfall of our house!
     If any spark of life be yet remaining,
     Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
     Stabs him again
     I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
     Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
     For I have often heard my mother say
     I came into the world with my legs forward:
     Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
     And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
     The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
     'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
     And so I was; which plainly signified
     That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
     Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
     Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
     I have no brother, I am like no brother;
     And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
     Be resident in men like one another
     And not in me: I am myself alone.
     Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
     But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
     For I will buz abroad such prophecies
     That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
     And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
     King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
     Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
     Counting myself but bad till I be best.
     I'll throw thy body in another room
     And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
     Exit, with the body
**** SCENE VII. London. The palace. ****
     Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH, CLARENCE,
     GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the young Prince, and Attendants
KING EDWARD IV
     Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
     Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
     What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
     Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
     Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
     For hardy and undoubted champions;
     Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
     And two Northumberlands; two braver men
     Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
     With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
     That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
     And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
     Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
     And made our footstool of security.
     Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
     Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
     Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
     Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
     That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
     And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
GLOUCESTER
     [Aside] I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;
     For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
     This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;
     And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:
     Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.
KING EDWARD IV
     Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
     And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
CLARENCE
     The duty that I owe unto your majesty
     I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
     Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
GLOUCESTER
     And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
     Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
     Aside
     And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
KING EDWARD IV
     Now am I seated as my soul delights,
     Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
CLARENCE
     What will your grace have done with Margaret?
     Reignier, her father, to the king of France
     Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
     And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
KING EDWARD IV
     Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
     And now what rests but that we spend the time
     With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
     Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
     Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
     For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
     Exeunt
