Rousillon. The COUNT\\'s palace.\\\\n     Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in\\\\n     black\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     And I in going, madam, weep o\\'er my father\\'s death\\\\n     anew: but I must attend his majesty\\'s command, to\\\\n     whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,\\\\n     sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times\\\\n     good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose\\\\n     worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather\\\\n     than lack it where there is such abundance.\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     What hope is there of his majesty\\'s amendment?\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose\\\\n     practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and\\\\n     finds no other advantage in the process but only the\\\\n     losing of hope by time.\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that\\\\n     \\'had\\'! how sad a passage \\'tis!--whose skill was\\\\n     almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so\\\\n     far, would have made nature immortal, and death\\\\n     should have play for lack of work. Would, for the\\\\n     king\\'s sake, he were living! I think it would be\\\\n     the death of the king\\'s disease.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     How called you the man you speak of, madam?\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was\\\\n     his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very\\\\n     lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he\\\\n     was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge\\\\n     could be set up against mortality.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     A fistula, my lord.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     I heard not of it before.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman\\\\n     the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my\\\\n     overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that\\\\n     her education promises; her dispositions she\\\\n     inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where\\\\n     an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there\\\\n     commendations go with pity; they are virtues and\\\\n     traitors too; in her they are the better for their\\\\n     simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     \\'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise\\\\n     in. The remembrance of her father never approaches\\\\n     her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all\\\\n     livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;\\\\n     go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect\\\\n     a sorrow than have it.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,\\\\n     excessive grief the enemy to the living.\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess\\\\n     makes it soon mortal.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     Madam, I desire your holy wishes.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     How understand we that?\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\\\\n     In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue\\\\n     Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\\\\n     Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\\\\n     Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy\\\\n     Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend\\\\n     Under thy own life\\'s key: be cheque\\'d for silence,\\\\n     But never tax\\'d for speech. What heaven more will,\\\\n     That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\\\\n     Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;\\\\n     \\'Tis an unseason\\'d courtier; good my lord,\\\\n     Advise him.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     He cannot want the best\\\\n     That shall attend his love.\\\\nCOUNTESS\\\\n     Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\\\\n     Exit\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     (To HELENA) \\\\n     The best wishes that can be forged in\\\\n     your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable\\\\n     to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of\\\\n     your father.\\\\n     Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     O, were that all! I think not on my father;\\\\n     And these great tears grace his remembrance more\\\\n     Than those I shed for him. What was he like?\\\\n     I have forgot him: my imagination\\\\n     Carries no favour in\\'t but Bertram\\'s.\\\\n     I am undone: there is no living, none,\\\\n     If Bertram be away. \\'Twere all one\\\\n     That I should love a bright particular star\\\\n     And think to wed it, he is so above me:\\\\n     In his bright radiance and collateral light\\\\n     Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.\\\\n     The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\\\\n     The hind that would be mated by the lion\\\\n     Must die for love. \\'Twas pretty, though plague,\\\\n     To see him every hour; to sit and draw\\\\n     His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\\\\n     In our heart\\'s table; heart too capable\\\\n     Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:\\\\n     But now he\\'s gone, and my idolatrous fancy\\\\n     Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?\\\\n     (Enter PAROLLES)\\\\n     (Aside)\\\\n     One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;\\\\n     And yet I know him a notorious liar,\\\\n     Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;\\\\n     Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,\\\\n     That they take place, when virtue\\'s steely bones\\\\n     Look bleak i\\' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see\\\\n     Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Save you, fair queen!\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     And you, monarch!\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     No.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     And no.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Are you meditating on virginity?\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me\\\\n     ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how\\\\n     may we barricado it against him?\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Keep him out.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,\\\\n     in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some\\\\n     warlike resistance.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     There is none: man, sitting down before you, will\\\\n     undermine you and blow you up.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Bless our poor virginity from underminers and\\\\n     blowers up! Is there no military policy, how\\\\n     virgins might blow up men?\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\\\\n     blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\\\\n     the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\\\\n     is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\\\\n     preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\\\\n     increase and there was never virgin got till\\\\n     virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\\\\n     metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\\\\n     may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\\\\n     ever lost: \\'tis too cold a companion; away with \\'t!\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     I will stand for \\'t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     There\\'s little can be said in \\'t; \\'tis against the\\\\n     rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\\\\n     is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\\\\n     disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\\\\n     virginity murders itself and should be buried in\\\\n     highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\\\\n     offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\\\\n     much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\\\\n     paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\\\\n     Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\\\\n     self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\\\\n     canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\\\\n     by\\'t: out with \\'t! within ten year it will make\\\\n     itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\\\\n     principal itself not much the worse: away with \\'t!\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne\\'er it\\\\n     likes. \\'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\\\\n     lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with \\'t\\\\n     while \\'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\\\\n     Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\\\\n     of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\\\\n     like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\\\\n     now. Your date is better in your pie and your\\\\n     porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\\\\n     your old virginity, is like one of our French\\\\n     withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\\\\n     \\'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\\\\n     marry, yet \\'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Not my virginity yet\\\\n     There shall your master have a thousand loves,\\\\n     A mother and a mistress and a friend,\\\\n     A phoenix, captain and an enemy,\\\\n     A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\\\\n     A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;\\\\n     His humble ambition, proud humility,\\\\n     His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\\\\n     His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\\\\n     Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,\\\\n     That blinking Cupid gossips.

I will return perfect courtier; in the\\\\n     which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize\\\\n     thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier\\'s\\\\n     counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon\\\\n     thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and\\\\n     thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When\\\\n     thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast\\\\n     none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,\\\\n     and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.\\\\n     Exit\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\\\\n     Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\\\\n     Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull\\\\n     Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\\\\n     What power is it which mounts my love so high,\\\\n     That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\\\\n     The mightiest space in fortune nature brings\\\\n     To join like likes and kiss like native things.\\\\n     Impossible be strange attempts to those\\\\n     That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose\\\\n     What hath been cannot be: who ever strove\\\\n     So show her merit, that did miss her love?\\\\n     The king\\'s disease--my project may deceive me,\\\\n     But my intents are fix\\'d and will not leave me.\\\\n     Exit\\\\n**** SCENE II.

Hence is it that\\\\n     we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves\\\\n     into seeming knowledge, when we should submit\\\\n     ourselves to an unknown fear.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Why, \\'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath\\\\n     shot out in our latter times.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     And so \\'tis.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     To be relinquish\\'d of the artists,--\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     So I say.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Both of Galen and Paracelsus.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     So I say.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Right; so I say.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     That gave him out incurable,--\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Why, there \\'tis; so say I too.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Not to be helped,--\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Right; as \\'twere, a man assured of a--\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Uncertain life, and sure death.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Just, you say well; so would I have said.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you\\\\n     shall read it in--what do you call there?\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     That\\'s it; I would have said the very same.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Why, your dolphin is not lustier: \\'fore me,\\\\n     I speak in respect--\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Nay, \\'tis strange, \\'tis very strange, that is the\\\\n     brief and the tedious of it; and he\\'s of a most\\\\n     facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Very hand of heaven.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Ay, so I say.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     In a most weak--\\\\n     pausing\\\\n     and debile minister, great power, great\\\\n     transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a\\\\n     further use to be made than alone the recovery of\\\\n     the king, as to be--\\\\n     pausing\\\\n     generally thankful.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.\\\\n     Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I\\'ll like a maid the\\\\n     better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he\\'s\\\\n     able to lead her a coranto.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     \\'Fore God, I think so.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Go, call before me all the lords in court.\\\\n     Sit, my preserver, by thy patient\\'s side;\\\\n     And with this healthful hand, whose banish\\'d sense\\\\n     Thou hast repeal\\'d, a second time receive\\\\n     The confirmation of my promised gift,\\\\n     Which but attends thy naming.\\\\n     Enter three or four Lords\\\\n     Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel\\\\n     Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,\\\\n     O\\'er whom both sovereign power and father\\'s voice\\\\n     I have to use: thy frank election make;\\\\n     Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress\\\\n     Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     I\\'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,\\\\n     My mouth no more were broken than these boys\\',\\\\n     And writ as little beard.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Peruse them well:\\\\n     Not one of those but had a noble father.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Gentlemen,\\\\n     Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.\\\\nAll\\\\n     We understand it, and thank heaven for you.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,\\\\n     That I protest I simply am a maid.\\\\n     Please it your majesty, I have done already:\\\\n     The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,\\\\n     \\'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,\\\\n     Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;\\\\n     We\\'ll ne\\'er come there again.\\'\\\\nKING\\\\n     Make choice; and, see,\\\\n     Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,\\\\n     And to imperial Love, that god most high,\\\\n     Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?\\\\nFirst Lord\\\\n     And grant it.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace\\\\n     for my life.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,\\\\n     Before I speak, too threateningly replies:\\\\n     Love make your fortunes twenty times above\\\\n     Her that so wishes and her humble love!\\\\nSecond Lord\\\\n     No better, if you please.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     My wish receive,\\\\n     Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,\\\\n     I\\'d have them whipped; or I would send them to the\\\\n     Turk, to make eunuchs of.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     Be not afraid that I your hand should take;\\\\n     I\\'ll never do you wrong for your own sake:\\\\n     Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed\\\\n     Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     These boys are boys of ice, they\\'ll none have her:\\\\n     sure, they are bastards to the English; the French\\\\n     ne\\'er got \\'em.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     You are too young, too happy, and too good,\\\\n     To make yourself a son out of my blood.\\\\nFourth Lord\\\\n     Fair one, I think not so.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     There\\'s one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk\\\\n     wine: but if thou be\\'st not an ass, I am a youth\\\\n     of fourteen; I have known thee already.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     [To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give\\\\n     Me and my service, ever whilst I live,\\\\n     Into your guiding power. This is the man.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she\\'s thy wife.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\\\\n     In such a business give me leave to use\\\\n     The help of mine own eyes.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Know\\'st thou not, Bertram,\\\\n     What she has done for me?\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     Yes, my good lord;\\\\n     But never hope to know why I should marry her.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Thou know\\'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     But follows it, my lord, to bring me down\\\\n     Must answer for your raising? I know her well:\\\\n     She had her breeding at my father\\'s charge.\\\\n     A poor physician\\'s daughter my wife! Disdain\\\\n     Rather corrupt me ever!\\\\nKING\\\\n     \\'Tis only title thou disdain\\'st in her, the which\\\\n     I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\\\\n     Of colour, weight, and heat, pour\\'d all together,\\\\n     Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off\\\\n     In differences so mighty. If she be\\\\n     All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,\\\\n     A poor physician\\'s daughter, thou dislikest\\\\n     Of virtue for the name: but do not so:\\\\n     From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\\\\n     The place is dignified by the doer\\'s deed:\\\\n     Where great additions swell\\'s, and virtue none,\\\\n     It is a dropsied honour. Good alone\\\\n     Is good without a name. Vileness is so:\\\\n     The property by what it is should go,\\\\n     Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\\\\n     In these to nature she\\'s immediate heir,\\\\n     And these breed honour: that is honour\\'s scorn,\\\\n     Which challenges itself as honour\\'s born\\\\n     And is not like the sire: honours thrive,\\\\n     When rather from our acts we them derive\\\\n     Than our foregoers: the mere word\\'s a slave\\\\n     Debosh\\'d on every tomb, on every grave\\\\n     A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\\\\n     Where dust and damn\\'d oblivion is the tomb\\\\n     Of honour\\'d bones indeed. What should be said?\\\\n     If thou canst like this creature as a maid,\\\\n     I can create the rest: virtue and she\\\\n     Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     I cannot love her, nor will strive to do\\'t.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Thou wrong\\'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.\\\\nHELENA\\\\n     That you are well restored, my lord, I\\'m glad:\\\\n     Let the rest go.\\\\nKING\\\\n     My honour\\'s at the stake; which to defeat,\\\\n     I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\\\\n     Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;\\\\n     That dost in vile misprision shackle up\\\\n     My love and her desert; that canst not dream,\\\\n     We, poising us in her defective scale,\\\\n     Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,\\\\n     It is in us to plant thine honour where\\\\n     We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:\\\\n     Obey our will, which travails in thy good:\\\\n     Believe not thy disdain, but presently\\\\n     Do thine own fortunes that obedient right\\\\n     Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;\\\\n     Or I will throw thee from my care for ever\\\\n     Into the staggers and the careless lapse\\\\n     Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\\\\n     Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,\\\\n     Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit\\\\n     My fancy to your eyes: when I consider\\\\n     What great creation and what dole of honour\\\\n     Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\\\\n     Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\\\\n     The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\\\\n     Is as \\'twere born so.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Take her by the hand,\\\\n     And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise\\\\n     A counterpoise, if not to thy estate\\\\n     A balance more replete.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     I take her hand.\\\\nKING\\\\n     Good fortune and the favour of the king\\\\n     Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony\\\\n     Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\\\\n     And be perform\\'d to-night: the solemn feast\\\\n     Shall more attend upon the coming space,\\\\n     Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,\\\\n     Thy love\\'s to me religious; else, does err.\\\\n     Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     [Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Your pleasure, sir?\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     Your lord and master did well to make his\\\\n     recantation.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Recantation!

I have a desire to hold\\\\n     my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,\\\\n     that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.\\\\nLAFEU\\\\n     I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor\\\\n     doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by\\\\n     thee, in what motion age will give me leave.\\\\n     Exit\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off\\\\n     me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord!

A drum so lost!\\\\n     There was excellent command,--to charge in with our\\\\n     horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!\\\\nFirst Lord\\\\n     That was not to be blamed in the command of the\\\\n     service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar\\\\n     himself could not have prevented, if he had been\\\\n     there to command.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some\\\\n     dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is\\\\n     not to be recovered.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     It might have been recovered.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     It might; but it is not now.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     It is to be recovered: but that the merit of\\\\n     service is seldom attributed to the true and exact\\\\n     performer, I would have that drum or another, or\\\\n     \\'hic jacet.\\'\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     Why, if you have a stomach, to\\'t, monsieur: if you\\\\n     think your mystery in stratagem can bring this\\\\n     instrument of honour again into his native quarter,\\\\n     be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will\\\\n     grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you\\\\n     speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.\\\\n     and extend to you what further becomes his\\\\n     greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your\\\\n     worthiness.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     But you must not now slumber in it.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     I\\'ll about it this evening: and I will presently\\\\n     pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my\\\\n     certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;\\\\n     and by midnight look to hear further from me.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     I know not what the success will be, my lord; but\\\\n     the attempt I vow.\\\\nBERTRAM\\\\n     I know thou\\'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of\\\\n     thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.\\\\nPAROLLES\\\\n     I love not many words.\\\\n     Exit\\\\nSecond Lord\\\\n     No more than a fish loves water.
