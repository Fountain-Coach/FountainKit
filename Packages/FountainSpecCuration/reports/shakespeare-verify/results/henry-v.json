There is no bar\\\\n     To make against your highness\\' claim to France\\\\n     But this, which they produce from Pharamond,\\\\n     \\'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:\\'\\\\n     \\'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:\\'\\\\n     Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze\\\\n     To be the realm of France, and Pharamond\\\\n     The founder of this law and female bar.\\\\n     Yet their own authors faithfully affirm\\\\n     That the land Salique is in Germany,\\\\n     Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;\\\\n     Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,\\\\n     There left behind and settled certain French;\\\\n     Who, holding in disdain the German women\\\\n     For some dishonest manners of their life,\\\\n     Establish\\'d then this law; to wit, no female\\\\n     Should be inheritrix in Salique land:\\\\n     Which Salique, as I said, \\'twixt Elbe and Sala,\\\\n     Is at this day in Germany call\\'d Meisen.\\\\n     Then doth it well appear that Salique law\\\\n     Was not devised for the realm of France:\\\\n     Nor did the French possess the Salique land\\\\n     Until four hundred one and twenty years\\\\n     After defunction of King Pharamond,\\\\n     Idly supposed the founder of this law;\\\\n     Who died within the year of our redemption\\\\n     Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great\\\\n     Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French\\\\n     Beyond the river Sala, in the year\\\\n     Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,\\\\n     King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,\\\\n     Did, as heir general, being descended\\\\n     Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,\\\\n     Make claim and title to the crown of France.\\\\n     Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown\\\\n     Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male\\\\n     Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,\\\\n     To find his title with some shows of truth,\\\\n     \\'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,\\\\n     Convey\\'d himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,\\\\n     Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son\\\\n     To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son\\\\n     Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,\\\\n     Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,\\\\n     Could not keep quiet in his conscience,\\\\n     Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied\\\\n     That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,\\\\n     Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,\\\\n     Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:\\\\n     By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great\\\\n     Was re-united to the crown of France.\\\\n     So that, as clear as is the summer\\'s sun.\\\\n     King Pepin\\'s title and Hugh Capet\\'s claim,\\\\n     King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear\\\\n     To hold in right and title of the female:\\\\n     So do the kings of France unto this day;\\\\n     Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law\\\\n     To bar your highness claiming from the female,\\\\n     And rather choose to hide them in a net\\\\n     Than amply to imbar their crooked titles\\\\n     Usurp\\'d from you and your progenitors.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     May I with right and conscience make this claim?\\\\nCANTERBURY\\\\n     The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\\\\n     For in the book of Numbers is it writ,\\\\n     When the man dies, let the inheritance\\\\n     Descend unto the daughter.

I am boy to them all three: but all they\\\\n     three, though they would serve me, could not be man\\\\n     to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to\\\\n     a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and\\\\n     red-faced; by the means whereof a\\' faces it out, but\\\\n     fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue\\\\n     and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a\\' breaks\\\\n     words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath\\\\n     heard that men of few words are the best men; and\\\\n     therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a\\'\\\\n     should be thought a coward: but his few bad words\\\\n     are matched with as few good deeds; for a\\' never\\\\n     broke any man\\'s head but his own, and that was\\\\n     against a post when he was drunk. They will steal\\\\n     any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a\\\\n     lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for\\\\n     three half pence.

Fortune is\\\\n     painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to\\\\n     signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is\\\\n     painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which\\\\n     is the moral of it, that she is turning, and\\\\n     inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her\\\\n     foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,\\\\n     which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,\\\\n     the poet makes a most excellent description of it:\\\\n     Fortune is an excellent moral.\\\\nPISTOL\\\\n     Fortune is Bardolph\\'s foe, and frowns on him;\\\\n     For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a\\' be:\\\\n     A damned death!\\\\n     Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free\\\\n     And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:\\\\n     But Exeter hath given the doom of death\\\\n     For pax of little price.\\\\n     Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:\\\\n     And let not Bardolph\\'s vital thread be cut\\\\n     With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:\\\\n     Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.\\\\nPISTOL\\\\n     Why then, rejoice therefore.\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice\\\\n     at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would\\\\n     desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put\\\\n     him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.\\\\nPISTOL\\\\n     Die and be damn\\'d! and figo for thy friendship!\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     It is well.\\\\nPISTOL\\\\n     The fig of Spain!\\\\n     Exit\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     Very good.\\\\nGOWER\\\\n     Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I\\\\n     remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     I\\'ll assure you, a\\' uttered as brave words at the\\\\n     bridge as you shall see in a summer\\'s day. But it\\\\n     is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,\\\\n     I warrant you, when time is serve.\\\\nGOWER\\\\n     Why, \\'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then\\\\n     goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return\\\\n     into London under the form of a soldier. And such\\\\n     fellows are perfect in the great commanders\\' names:\\\\n     and they will learn you by rote where services were\\\\n     done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,\\\\n     at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was\\\\n     shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;\\\\n     and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,\\\\n     which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what\\\\n     a beard of the general\\'s cut and a horrid suit of\\\\n     the camp will do among foaming bottles and\\\\n     ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But\\\\n     you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or\\\\n     else you may be marvellously mistook.\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is\\\\n     not the man that he would gladly make show to the\\\\n     world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will\\\\n     tell him my mind.\\\\n     Drum heard\\\\n     Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with\\\\n     him from the pridge.\\\\n     Drum and colours.

The Duke of Exeter has\\\\n     very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is\\\\n     gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most\\\\n     prave passages; marry, th\\' athversary was have\\\\n     possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to\\\\n     retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the\\\\n     pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a\\\\n     prave man.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     What men have you lost, Fluellen?\\\\nFLUELLEN\\\\n     The perdition of th\\' athversary hath been very\\\\n     great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I\\\\n     think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that\\\\n     is like to be executed for robbing a church, one\\\\n     Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is\\\\n     all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o\\'\\\\n     fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like\\\\n     a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;\\\\n     but his nose is executed and his fire\\'s out.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we\\\\n     give express charge, that in our marches through the\\\\n     country, there be nothing compelled from the\\\\n     villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the\\\\n     French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;\\\\n     for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the\\\\n     gentler gamester is the soonest winner.\\\\n     Tucket.

Tell him we\\\\n     could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we\\\\n     thought not good to bruise an injury till it were\\\\n     full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice\\\\n     is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see\\\\n     his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him\\\\n     therefore consider of his ransom; which must\\\\n     proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we\\\\n     have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in\\\\n     weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.\\\\n     For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the\\\\n     effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too\\\\n     faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own\\\\n     person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and\\\\n     worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and\\\\n     tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his\\\\n     followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far\\\\n     my king and master; so much my office.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     What is thy name?

Turn thee back.\\\\n     And tell thy king I do not seek him now;\\\\n     But could be willing to march on to Calais\\\\n     Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,\\\\n     Though \\'tis no wisdom to confess so much\\\\n     Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,\\\\n     My people are with sickness much enfeebled,\\\\n     My numbers lessened, and those few I have\\\\n     Almost no better than so many French;\\\\n     Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,\\\\n     I thought upon one pair of English legs\\\\n     Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,\\\\n     That I do brag thus! This your air of France\\\\n     Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.\\\\n     Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;\\\\n     My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,\\\\n     My army but a weak and sickly guard;\\\\n     Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,\\\\n     Though France himself and such another neighbour\\\\n     Stand in our way. There\\'s for thy labour, Montjoy.\\\\n     Go bid thy master well advise himself:\\\\n     If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder\\'d,\\\\n     We shall your tawny ground with your red blood\\\\n     Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.\\\\n     The sum of all our answer is but this:\\\\n     We would not seek a battle, as we are;\\\\n     Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:\\\\n     So tell your master.\\\\nMONTJOY\\\\n     I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.\\\\n     Exit\\\\nGLOUCESTER\\\\n     I hope they will not come upon us now.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     We are in God\\'s hand, brother, not in theirs.\\\\n     March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:\\\\n     Beyond the river we\\'ll encamp ourselves,\\\\n     And on to-morrow, bid them march away.\\\\n     Exeunt\\\\n**** SCENE VII.

Who goes there?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     A friend.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     Under what captain serve you?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I\\\\n     pray you, what thinks he of our estate?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be\\\\n     washed off the next tide.\\\\nBATES\\\\n     He hath not told his thought to the king?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I\\\\n     speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I\\\\n     am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the\\\\n     element shows to him as it doth to me; all his\\\\n     senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies\\\\n     laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and\\\\n     though his affections are higher mounted than ours,\\\\n     yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like\\\\n     wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we\\\\n     do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish\\\\n     as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess\\\\n     him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing\\\\n     it, should dishearten his army.\\\\nBATES\\\\n     He may show what outward courage he will; but I\\\\n     believe, as cold a night as \\'tis, he could wish\\\\n     himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he\\\\n     were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:\\\\n     I think he would not wish himself any where but\\\\n     where he is.\\\\nBATES\\\\n     Then I would he were here alone; so should he be\\\\n     sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men\\'s lives saved.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here\\\\n     alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men\\'s\\\\n     minds: methinks I could not die any where so\\\\n     contented as in the king\\'s company; his cause being\\\\n     just and his quarrel honourable.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     That\\'s more than we know.\\\\nBATES\\\\n     Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know\\\\n     enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if\\\\n     his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes\\\\n     the crime of it out of us.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath\\\\n     a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and\\\\n     arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join\\\\n     together at the latter day and cry all \\'We died at\\\\n     such a place;\\' some swearing, some crying for a\\\\n     surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind\\\\n     them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their\\\\n     children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die\\\\n     well that die in a battle; for how can they\\\\n     charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their\\\\n     argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it\\\\n     will be a black matter for the king that led them to\\\\n     it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of\\\\n     subjection.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     So, if a son that is by his father sent about\\\\n     merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the\\\\n     imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be\\\\n     imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a\\\\n     servant, under his master\\'s command transporting a\\\\n     sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in\\\\n     many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the\\\\n     business of the master the author of the servant\\'s\\\\n     damnation: but this is not so: the king is not\\\\n     bound to answer the particular endings of his\\\\n     soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of\\\\n     his servant; for they purpose not their death, when\\\\n     they purpose their services. Besides, there is no\\\\n     king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to\\\\n     the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all\\\\n     unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them\\\\n     the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;\\\\n     some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of\\\\n     perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that\\\\n     have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with\\\\n     pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have\\\\n     defeated the law and outrun native punishment,\\\\n     though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to\\\\n     fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;\\\\n     so that here men are punished for before-breach of\\\\n     the king\\'s laws in now the king\\'s quarrel: where\\\\n     they feared the death, they have borne life away;\\\\n     and where they would be safe, they perish: then if\\\\n     they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of\\\\n     their damnation than he was before guilty of those\\\\n     impieties for the which they are now visited. Every\\\\n     subject\\'s duty is the king\\'s; but every subject\\'s\\\\n     soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in\\\\n     the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every\\\\n     mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death\\\\n     is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was\\\\n     blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:\\\\n     and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think\\\\n     that, making God so free an offer, He let him\\\\n     outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach\\\\n     others how they should prepare.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     \\'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon\\\\n     his own head, the king is not to answer it.\\\\nBATES\\\\n     But I do not desire he should answer for me; and\\\\n     yet I determine to fight lustily for him.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but\\\\n     when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we\\\\n     ne\\'er the wiser.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     You pay him then. That\\'s a perilous shot out of an\\\\n     elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can\\\\n     do against a monarch! you may as well go about to\\\\n     turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a\\\\n     peacock\\'s feather. You\\'ll never trust his word\\\\n     after! come, \\'tis a foolish saying.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Your reproof is something too round: I should be\\\\n     angry with you, if the time were convenient.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I embrace it.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     How shall I know thee again?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my\\\\n     bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I\\\\n     will make it my quarrel.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     Here\\'s my glove: give me another of thine.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     There.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come\\\\n     to me and say, after to-morrow, \\'This is my glove,\\'\\\\n     by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     Thou darest as well be hanged.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the\\\\n     king\\'s company.\\\\nWILLIAMS\\\\n     Keep thy word: fare thee well.\\\\nBATES\\\\n     Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have\\\\n     French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to\\\\n     one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their\\\\n     shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut\\\\n     French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will\\\\n     be a clipper.\\\\n     Exeunt soldiers\\\\n     Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,\\\\n     Our debts, our careful wives,\\\\n     Our children and our sins lay on the king!\\\\n     We must bear all.

That I have labour\\'d,\\\\n     With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,\\\\n     To bring your most imperial majesties\\\\n     Unto this bar and royal interview,\\\\n     Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.\\\\n     Since then my office hath so far prevail\\'d\\\\n     That, face to face and royal eye to eye,\\\\n     You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,\\\\n     If I demand, before this royal view,\\\\n     What rub or what impediment there is,\\\\n     Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,\\\\n     Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,\\\\n     Should not in this best garden of the world\\\\n     Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?\\\\n     Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,\\\\n     And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,\\\\n     Corrupting in its own fertility.\\\\n     Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,\\\\n     Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach\\'d,\\\\n     Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,\\\\n     Put forth disorder\\'d twigs; her fallow leas\\\\n     The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory\\\\n     Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts\\\\n     That should deracinate such savagery;\\\\n     The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth\\\\n     The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,\\\\n     Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,\\\\n     Conceives by idleness and nothing teems\\\\n     But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,\\\\n     Losing both beauty and utility.\\\\n     And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,\\\\n     Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,\\\\n     Even so our houses and ourselves and children\\\\n     Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,\\\\n     The sciences that should become our country;\\\\n     But grow like savages,--as soldiers will\\\\n     That nothing do but meditate on blood,--\\\\n     To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire\\\\n     And every thing that seems unnatural.\\\\n     Which to reduce into our former favour\\\\n     You are assembled: and my speech entreats\\\\n     That I may know the let, why gentle Peace\\\\n     Should not expel these inconveniences\\\\n     And bless us with her former qualities.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,\\\\n     Whose want gives growth to the imperfections\\\\n     Which you have cited, you must buy that peace\\\\n     With full accord to all our just demands;\\\\n     Whose tenors and particular effects\\\\n     You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     The king hath heard them; to the which as yet\\\\n     There is no answer made.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Well then the peace,\\\\n     Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.\\\\nKING OF FRANCE\\\\n     I have but with a cursorary eye\\\\n     O\\'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace\\\\n     To appoint some of your council presently\\\\n     To sit with us once more, with better heed\\\\n     To re-survey them, we will suddenly\\\\n     Pass our accept and peremptory answer.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,\\\\n     And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,\\\\n     Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;\\\\n     And take with you free power to ratify,\\\\n     Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best\\\\n     Shall see advantageable for our dignity,\\\\n     Any thing in or out of our demands,\\\\n     And we\\'ll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,\\\\n     Go with the princes, or stay here with us?\\\\nQUEEN ISABEL\\\\n     Our gracious brother, I will go with them:\\\\n     Haply a woman\\'s voice may do some good,\\\\n     When articles too nicely urged be stood on.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:\\\\n     She is our capital demand, comprised\\\\n     Within the fore-rank of our articles.\\\\nQUEEN ISABEL\\\\n     She hath good leave.\\\\n     Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Fair Katharine, and most fair,\\\\n     Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms\\\\n     Such as will enter at a lady\\'s ear\\\\n     And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with\\\\n     your French heart, I will be glad to hear you\\\\n     confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do\\\\n     you like me, Kate?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is \\'like me.\\'\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?\\\\nALICE\\\\n     Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to\\\\n     affirm it.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de\\\\n     tromperies.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men\\\\n     are full of deceits?\\\\nALICE\\\\n     Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of\\\\n     deceits: dat is de princess.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     The princess is the better Englishwoman. I\\' faith,\\\\n     Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am\\\\n     glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if\\\\n     thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king\\\\n     that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my\\\\n     crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but\\\\n     directly to say \\'I love you:\\' then if you urge me\\\\n     farther than to say \\'do you in faith?\\' I wear out\\\\n     my suit. Give me your answer; i\\' faith, do: and so\\\\n     clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for\\\\n     your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I\\\\n     have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I\\\\n     have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable\\\\n     measure in strength. If I could win a lady at\\\\n     leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my\\\\n     armour on my back, under the correction of bragging\\\\n     be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.\\\\n     Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse\\\\n     for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and\\\\n     sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,\\\\n     Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my\\\\n     eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;\\\\n     only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,\\\\n     nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a\\\\n     fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth\\\\n     sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love\\\\n     of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy\\\\n     cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst\\\\n     love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee\\\\n     that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the\\\\n     Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou\\\\n     livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and\\\\n     uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee\\\\n     right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other\\\\n     places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that\\\\n     can rhyme themselves into ladies\\' favours, they do\\\\n     always reason themselves out again. What! a\\\\n     speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A\\\\n     good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a\\\\n     black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow\\\\n     bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax\\\\n     hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the\\\\n     moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it\\\\n     shines bright and never changes, but keeps his\\\\n     course truly. If thou would have such a one, take\\\\n     me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,\\\\n     take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?\\\\n     speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of\\\\n     France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love\\\\n     the friend of France; for I love France so well that\\\\n     I will not part with a village of it; I will have it\\\\n     all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am\\\\n     yours, then yours is France and you are mine.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     I cannot tell vat is dat.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am\\\\n     sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married\\\\n     wife about her husband\\'s neck, hardly to be shook\\\\n     off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand\\\\n     vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what\\\\n     then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est\\\\n     France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,\\\\n     Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much\\\\n     more French: I shall never move thee in French,\\\\n     unless it be to laugh at me.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il\\\\n     est meilleur que l\\'Anglois lequel je parle.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     No, faith, is\\'t not, Kate: but thy speaking of my\\\\n     tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs\\\\n     be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou\\\\n     understand thus much English, canst thou love me?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     I cannot tell.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I\\'ll ask\\\\n     them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,\\\\n     when you come into your closet, you\\'ll question this\\\\n     gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to\\\\n     her dispraise those parts in me that you love with\\\\n     your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the\\\\n     rather, gentle princess, because I love thee\\\\n     cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a\\\\n     saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get\\\\n     thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs\\\\n     prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,\\\\n     between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a\\\\n     boy, half French, half English, that shall go to\\\\n     Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?\\\\n     shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair\\\\n     flower-de-luce?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     I do not know dat\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     No; \\'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do\\\\n     but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your\\\\n     French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety\\\\n     take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer\\\\n     you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher\\\\n     et devin deesse?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de\\\\n     most sage demoiselle dat is en France.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in\\\\n     true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I\\\\n     dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to\\\\n     flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor\\\\n     and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew\\\\n     my father\\'s ambition! he was thinking of civil wars\\\\n     when he got me: therefore was I created with a\\\\n     stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when\\\\n     I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,\\\\n     Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:\\\\n     my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of\\\\n     beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou\\\\n     hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou\\\\n     shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:\\\\n     and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you\\\\n     have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the\\\\n     thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;\\\\n     take me by the hand, and say \\'Harry of England I am\\\\n     thine:\\' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine\\\\n     ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud \\'England is\\\\n     thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry\\\\n     Plantagenet is thine;\\' who though I speak it before\\\\n     his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,\\\\n     thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.\\\\n     Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is\\\\n     music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of\\\\n     all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken\\\\n     English; wilt thou have me?\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please\\\\n     him, Kate.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Den it sall also content me.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je\\\\n     ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en\\\\n     baisant la main d\\'une de votre seigeurie indigne\\\\n     serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon\\\\n     tres-puissant seigneur.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant\\\\n     leur noces, il n\\'est pas la coutume de France.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Madam my interpreter, what says she?\\\\nALICE\\\\n     Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of\\\\n     France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     To kiss.\\\\nALICE\\\\n     Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss\\\\n     before they are married, would she say?\\\\nALICE\\\\n     Oui, vraiment.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear\\\\n     Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak\\\\n     list of a country\\'s fashion: we are the makers of\\\\n     manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our\\\\n     places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will\\\\n     do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your\\\\n     country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently\\\\n     and yielding.\\\\n     Kissing her\\\\n     You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is\\\\n     more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the\\\\n     tongues of the French council; and they should\\\\n     sooner persuade Harry of England than a general\\\\n     petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.\\\\n     Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you\\\\n     our princess English?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how\\\\n     perfectly I love her; and that is good English.\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     Is she not apt?\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not\\\\n     smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the\\\\n     heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up\\\\n     the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in\\\\n     his true likeness.\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you\\\\n     for that. If you would conjure in her, you must\\\\n     make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true\\\\n     likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you\\\\n     blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the\\\\n     virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the\\\\n     appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing\\\\n     self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid\\\\n     to consign to.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     They are then excused, my lord, when they see not\\\\n     what they do.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will\\\\n     teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well\\\\n     summered and warm kept, are like flies at\\\\n     Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their\\\\n     eyes; and then they will endure handling, which\\\\n     before would not abide looking on.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;\\\\n     and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the\\\\n     latter end and she must be blind too.\\\\nBURGUNDY\\\\n     As love is, my lord, before it loves.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for\\\\n     my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city\\\\n     for one fair French maid that stands in my way.\\\\nFRENCH KING\\\\n     Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities\\\\n     turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with\\\\n     maiden walls that war hath never entered.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Shall Kate be my wife?\\\\nFRENCH KING\\\\n     So please you.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may\\\\n     wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for\\\\n     my wish shall show me the way to my will.\\\\nFRENCH KING\\\\n     We have consented to all terms of reason.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Is\\'t so, my lords of England?\\\\nWESTMORELAND\\\\n     The king hath granted every article:\\\\n     His daughter first, and then in sequel all,\\\\n     According to their firm proposed natures.\\\\nEXETER\\\\n     Only he hath not yet subscribed this:\\\\n     Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,\\\\n     having any occasion to write for matter of grant,\\\\n     shall name your highness in this form and with this\\\\n     addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi\\\\n     d\\'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in\\\\n     Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex\\\\n     Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.\\\\nFRENCH KING\\\\n     Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,\\\\n     But your request shall make me let it pass.\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,\\\\n     Let that one article rank with the rest;\\\\n     And thereupon give me your daughter.\\\\nFRENCH KING\\\\n     Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up\\\\n     Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms\\\\n     Of France and England, whose very shores look pale\\\\n     With envy of each other\\'s happiness,\\\\n     May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction\\\\n     Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord\\\\n     In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance\\\\n     His bleeding sword \\'twixt England and fair France.\\\\nALL\\\\n     Amen!\\\\nKING HENRY V\\\\n     Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,\\\\n     That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.\\\\n     Flourish\\\\nQUEEN ISABEL\\\\n     God, the best maker of all marriages,\\\\n     Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!\\\\n     As man and wife, being two, are one in love,\\\\n     So be there \\'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,\\\\n     That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,\\\\n     Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,\\\\n     Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,\\\\n     To make divorce of their incorporate league;\\\\n     That English may as French, French Englishmen,\\\\n     Receive each other.
