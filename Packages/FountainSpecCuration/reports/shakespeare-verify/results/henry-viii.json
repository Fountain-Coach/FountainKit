London. An ante-chamber in the palace. ****\\\\n     Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done\\\\n     Since last we saw in France?\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     I thank your grace,\\\\n     Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer\\\\n     Of what I saw there.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     An untimely ague\\\\n     Stay\\'d me a prisoner in my chamber when\\\\n     Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,\\\\n     Met in the vale of Andren.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     \\'Twixt Guynes and Arde:\\\\n     I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;\\\\n     Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung\\\\n     In their embracement, as they grew together;\\\\n     Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh\\'d\\\\n     Such a compounded one?\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     All the whole time\\\\n     I was my chamber\\'s prisoner.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Then you lost\\\\n     The view of earthly glory: men might say,\\\\n     Till this time pomp was single, but now married\\\\n     To one above itself. Each following day\\\\n     Became the next day\\'s master, till the last\\\\n     Made former wonders its. To-day the French,\\\\n     All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,\\\\n     Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they\\\\n     Made Britain India: every man that stood\\\\n     Show\\'d like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were\\\\n     As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,\\\\n     Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear\\\\n     The pride upon them, that their very labour\\\\n     Was to them as a painting: now this masque\\\\n     Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night\\\\n     Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,\\\\n     Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,\\\\n     As presence did present them; him in eye,\\\\n     Still him in praise: and, being present both\\\\n     \\'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner\\\\n     Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--\\\\n     For so they phrase \\'em--by their heralds challenged\\\\n     The noble spirits to arms, they did perform\\\\n     Beyond thought\\'s compass; that former fabulous story,\\\\n     Being now seen possible enough, got credit,\\\\n     That Bevis was believed.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     O, you go far.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     As I belong to worship and affect\\\\n     In honour honesty, the tract of every thing\\\\n     Would by a good discourser lose some life,\\\\n     Which action\\'s self was tongue to. All was royal;\\\\n     To the disposing of it nought rebell\\'d.\\\\n     Order gave each thing view; the office did\\\\n     Distinctly his full function.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Who did guide,\\\\n     I mean, who set the body and the limbs\\\\n     Of this great sport together, as you guess?\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     One, certes, that promises no element\\\\n     In such a business.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     I pray you, who, my lord?\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     All this was order\\'d by the good discretion\\\\n     Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     The devil speed him! no man\\'s pie is freed\\\\n     From his ambitious finger. What had he\\\\n     To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder\\\\n     That such a keech can with his very bulk\\\\n     Take up the rays o\\' the beneficial sun\\\\n     And keep it from the earth.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Surely, sir,\\\\n     There\\'s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;\\\\n     For, being not propp\\'d by ancestry, whose grace\\\\n     Chalks successors their way, nor call\\'d upon\\\\n     For high feats done to the crown; neither allied\\\\n     For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,\\\\n     Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,\\\\n     The force of his own merit makes his way\\\\n     A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys\\\\n     A place next to the king.\\\\nABERGAVENNY\\\\n     I cannot tell\\\\n     What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye\\\\n     Pierce into that; but I can see his pride\\\\n     Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,\\\\n     If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,\\\\n     Or has given all before, and he begins\\\\n     A new hell in himself.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Why the devil,\\\\n     Upon this French going out, took he upon him,\\\\n     Without the privity o\\' the king, to appoint\\\\n     Who should attend on him? He makes up the file\\\\n     Of all the gentry; for the most part such\\\\n     To whom as great a charge as little honour\\\\n     He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,\\\\n     The honourable board of council out,\\\\n     Must fetch him in the papers.\\\\nABERGAVENNY\\\\n     I do know\\\\n     Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have\\\\n     By this so sickened their estates, that never\\\\n     They shall abound as formerly.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     O, many\\\\n     Have broke their backs with laying manors on \\'em\\\\n     For this great journey. What did this vanity\\\\n     But minister communication of\\\\n     A most poor issue?\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Grievingly I think,\\\\n     The peace between the French and us not values\\\\n     The cost that did conclude it.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Every man,\\\\n     After the hideous storm that follow\\'d, was\\\\n     A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke\\\\n     Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,\\\\n     Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded\\\\n     The sudden breach on\\'t.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Which is budded out;\\\\n     For France hath flaw\\'d the league, and hath attach\\'d\\\\n     Our merchants\\' goods at Bourdeaux.\\\\nABERGAVENNY\\\\n     Is it therefore\\\\n     The ambassador is silenced?\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Marry, is\\'t.\\\\nABERGAVENNY\\\\n     A proper title of a peace; and purchased\\\\n     At a superfluous rate!\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Why, all this business\\\\n     Our reverend cardinal carried.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Like it your grace,\\\\n     The state takes notice of the private difference\\\\n     Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--\\\\n     And take it from a heart that wishes towards you\\\\n     Honour and plenteous safety--that you read\\\\n     The cardinal\\'s malice and his potency\\\\n     Together; to consider further that\\\\n     What his high hatred would effect wants not\\\\n     A minister in his power. You know his nature,\\\\n     That he\\'s revengeful, and I know his sword\\\\n     Hath a sharp edge: it\\'s long and, \\'t may be said,\\\\n     It reaches far, and where \\'twill not extend,\\\\n     Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,\\\\n     You\\'ll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock\\\\n     That I advise your shunning.\\\\n     Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him, certain of the\\\\n     Guard, and two Secretaries with papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his\\\\n     passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both\\\\n     full of disdain\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     The Duke of Buckingham\\'s surveyor, ha?\\\\n     Where\\'s his examination?\\\\nFirst Secretary\\\\n     Here, so please you.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Is he in person ready?\\\\nFirst Secretary\\\\n     Ay, please your grace.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham\\\\n     Shall lessen this big look.\\\\n     Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     This butcher\\'s cur is venom-mouth\\'d, and I\\\\n     Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best\\\\n     Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar\\'s book\\\\n     Outworths a noble\\'s blood.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     What, are you chafed?\\\\n     Ask God for temperance; that\\'s the appliance only\\\\n     Which your disease requires.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     I read in\\'s looks\\\\n     Matter against me; and his eye reviled\\\\n     Me, as his abject object: at this instant\\\\n     He bores me with some trick: he\\'s gone to the king;\\\\n     I\\'ll follow and outstare him.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Stay, my lord,\\\\n     And let your reason with your choler question\\\\n     What \\'tis you go about: to climb steep hills\\\\n     Requires slow pace at first: anger is like\\\\n     A full-hot horse, who being allow\\'d his way,\\\\n     Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England\\\\n     Can advise me like you: be to yourself\\\\n     As you would to your friend.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     I\\'ll to the king;\\\\n     And from a mouth of honour quite cry down\\\\n     This Ipswich fellow\\'s insolence; or proclaim\\\\n     There\\'s difference in no persons.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Be advised;\\\\n     Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot\\\\n     That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,\\\\n     By violent swiftness, that which we run at,\\\\n     And lose by over-running. Know you not,\\\\n     The fire that mounts the liquor til run o\\'er,\\\\n     In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:\\\\n     I say again, there is no English soul\\\\n     More stronger to direct you than yourself,\\\\n     If with the sap of reason you would quench,\\\\n     Or but allay, the fire of passion.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Sir,\\\\n     I am thankful to you; and I\\'ll go along\\\\n     By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,\\\\n     Whom from the flow of gall I name not but\\\\n     From sincere motions, by intelligence,\\\\n     And proofs as clear as founts in July when\\\\n     We see each grain of gravel, I do know\\\\n     To be corrupt and treasonous.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Say not \\'treasonous.\\'\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     To the king I\\'ll say\\'t; and make my vouch as strong\\\\n     As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,\\\\n     Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous\\\\n     As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief\\\\n     As able to perform\\'t; his mind and place\\\\n     Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--\\\\n     Only to show his pomp as well in France\\\\n     As here at home, suggests the king our master\\\\n     To this last costly treaty, the interview,\\\\n     That swallow\\'d so much treasure, and like a glass\\\\n     Did break i\\' the rinsing.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Faith, and so it did.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal\\\\n     The articles o\\' the combination drew\\\\n     As himself pleased; and they were ratified\\\\n     As he cried \\'Thus let be\\': to as much end\\\\n     As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal\\\\n     Has done this, and \\'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,\\\\n     Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--\\\\n     Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy\\\\n     To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,\\\\n     Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--\\\\n     For \\'twas indeed his colour, but he came\\\\n     To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:\\\\n     His fears were, that the interview betwixt\\\\n     England and France might, through their amity,\\\\n     Breed him some prejudice; for from this league\\\\n     Peep\\'d harms that menaced him: he privily\\\\n     Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--\\\\n     Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor\\\\n     Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted\\\\n     Ere it was ask\\'d; but when the way was made,\\\\n     And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,\\\\n     That he would please to alter the king\\'s course,\\\\n     And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,\\\\n     As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal\\\\n     Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,\\\\n     And for his own advantage.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     I am sorry\\\\n     To hear this of him; and could wish he were\\\\n     Something mistaken in\\'t.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     No, not a syllable:\\\\n     I do pronounce him in that very shape\\\\n     He shall appear in proof.\\\\n     Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the\\\\n     Guard\\\\nBRANDON\\\\n     Your office, sergeant; execute it.\\\\nSergeant\\\\n     Sir,\\\\n     My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl\\\\n     Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I\\\\n     Arrest thee of high treason, in the name\\\\n     Of our most sovereign king.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     Lo, you, my lord,\\\\n     The net has fall\\'n upon me! I shall perish\\\\n     Under device and practise.\\\\nBRANDON\\\\n     I am sorry\\\\n     To see you ta\\'en from liberty, to look on\\\\n     The business present: \\'tis his highness\\' pleasure\\\\n     You shall to the Tower.\\\\nBUCKINGHAM\\\\n     It will help me nothing\\\\n     To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me\\\\n     Which makes my whitest part black.

Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on CARDINAL WOLSEY\\'s\\\\n     shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL; CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself\\\\n     under KING HENRY VIII\\'s feet on his right side\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     My life itself, and the best heart of it,\\\\n     Thanks you for this great care: I stood i\\' the level\\\\n     Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks\\\\n     To you that choked it. Let be call\\'d before us\\\\n     That gentleman of Buckingham\\'s; in person\\\\n     I\\'ll hear him his confessions justify;\\\\n     And point by point the treasons of his master\\\\n     He shall again relate.\\\\n     A noise within, crying \\'Room for the Queen!\\' Enter QUEEN KATHARINE,\\\\n     ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK: she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth\\\\n     from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Arise, and take place by us: half your suit\\\\n     Never name to us; you have half our power:\\\\n     The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;\\\\n     Repeat your will and take it.\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     Thank your majesty.\\\\n     That you would love yourself, and in that love\\\\n     Not unconsider\\'d leave your honour, nor\\\\n     The dignity of your office, is the point\\\\n     Of my petition.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Lady mine, proceed.\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     I am solicited, not by a few,\\\\n     And those of true condition, that your subjects\\\\n     Are in great grievance: there have been commissions\\\\n     Sent down among \\'em, which hath flaw\\'d the heart\\\\n     Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,\\\\n     My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches\\\\n     Most bitterly on you, as putter on\\\\n     Of these exactions, yet the king our master--\\\\n     Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he\\\\n     escapes not\\\\n     Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks\\\\n     The sides of loyalty, and almost appears\\\\n     In loud rebellion.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Not almost appears,\\\\n     It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,\\\\n     The clothiers all, not able to maintain\\\\n     The many to them longing, have put off\\\\n     The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,\\\\n     Unfit for other life, compell\\'d by hunger\\\\n     And lack of other means, in desperate manner\\\\n     Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,\\\\n     And danger serves among then!\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Taxation!\\\\n     Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,\\\\n     You that are blamed for it alike with us,\\\\n     Know you of this taxation?\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Please you, sir,\\\\n     I know but of a single part, in aught\\\\n     Pertains to the state; and front but in that file\\\\n     Where others tell steps with me.\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     No, my lord,\\\\n     You know no more than others; but you frame\\\\n     Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome\\\\n     To those which would not know them, and yet must\\\\n     Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,\\\\n     Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are\\\\n     Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear \\'em,\\\\n     The back is sacrifice to the load. They say\\\\n     They are devised by you; or else you suffer\\\\n     Too hard an exclamation.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Still exaction!\\\\n     The nature of it? in what kind, let\\'s know,\\\\n     Is this exaction?\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     I am much too venturous\\\\n     In tempting of your patience; but am bolden\\'d\\\\n     Under your promised pardon. The subjects\\' grief\\\\n     Comes through commissions, which compel from each\\\\n     The sixth part of his substance, to be levied\\\\n     Without delay; and the pretence for this\\\\n     Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:\\\\n     Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze\\\\n     Allegiance in them; their curses now\\\\n     Live where their prayers did: and it\\'s come to pass,\\\\n     This tractable obedience is a slave\\\\n     To each incensed will. I would your highness\\\\n     Would give it quick consideration, for\\\\n     There is no primer business.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     By my life,\\\\n     This is against our pleasure.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     And for me,\\\\n     I have no further gone in this than by\\\\n     A single voice; and that not pass\\'d me but\\\\n     By learned approbation of the judges. If I am\\\\n     Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know\\\\n     My faculties nor person, yet will be\\\\n     The chronicles of my doing, let me say\\\\n     \\'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake\\\\n     That virtue must go through. We must not stint\\\\n     Our necessary actions, in the fear\\\\n     To cope malicious censurers; which ever,\\\\n     As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow\\\\n     That is new-trimm\\'d, but benefit no further\\\\n     Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,\\\\n     By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is\\\\n     Not ours, or not allow\\'d; what worst, as oft,\\\\n     Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up\\\\n     For our best act. If we shall stand still,\\\\n     In fear our motion will be mock\\'d or carp\\'d at,\\\\n     We should take root here where we sit, or sit\\\\n     State-statues only.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Things done well,\\\\n     And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;\\\\n     Things done without example, in their issue\\\\n     Are to be fear\\'d. Have you a precedent\\\\n     Of this commission? I believe, not any.\\\\n     We must not rend our subjects from our laws,\\\\n     And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?\\\\n     A trembling contribution! Why, we take\\\\n     From every tree lop, bark, and part o\\' the timber;\\\\n     And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack\\'d,\\\\n     The air will drink the sap. To every county\\\\n     Where this is question\\'d send our letters, with\\\\n     Free pardon to each man that has denied\\\\n     The force of this commission: pray, look to\\'t;\\\\n     I put it to your care.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     A word with you.\\\\n     To the Secretary\\\\n     Let there be letters writ to every shire,\\\\n     Of the king\\'s grace and pardon. The grieved commons\\\\n     Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised\\\\n     That through our intercession this revokement\\\\n     And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you\\\\n     Further in the proceeding.\\\\n     Exit Secretary\\\\n     Enter Surveyor\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham\\\\n     Is run in your displeasure.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     It grieves many:\\\\n     The gentleman is learn\\'d, and a most rare speaker;\\\\n     To nature none more bound; his training such,\\\\n     That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,\\\\n     And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,\\\\n     When these so noble benefits shall prove\\\\n     Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,\\\\n     They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly\\\\n     Than ever they were fair.

Sir, call to mind\\\\n     That I have been your wife, in this obedience,\\\\n     Upward of twenty years, and have been blest\\\\n     With many children by you: if, in the course\\\\n     And process of this time, you can report,\\\\n     And prove it too, against mine honour aught,\\\\n     My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,\\\\n     Against your sacred person, in God\\'s name,\\\\n     Turn me away; and let the foul\\'st contempt\\\\n     Shut door upon me, and so give me up\\\\n     To the sharp\\'st kind of justice. Please you sir,\\\\n     The king, your father, was reputed for\\\\n     A prince most prudent, of an excellent\\\\n     And unmatch\\'d wit and judgment: Ferdinand,\\\\n     My father, king of Spain, was reckon\\'d one\\\\n     The wisest prince that there had reign\\'d by many\\\\n     A year before: it is not to be question\\'d\\\\n     That they had gather\\'d a wise council to them\\\\n     Of every realm, that did debate this business,\\\\n     Who deem\\'d our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly\\\\n     Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may\\\\n     Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel\\\\n     I will implore: if not, i\\' the name of God,\\\\n     Your pleasure be fulfill\\'d!\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     You have here, lady,\\\\n     And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men\\\\n     Of singular integrity and learning,\\\\n     Yea, the elect o\\' the land, who are assembled\\\\n     To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless\\\\n     That longer you desire the court; as well\\\\n     For your own quiet, as to rectify\\\\n     What is unsettled in the king.\\\\nCARDINAL CAMPEIUS\\\\n     His grace\\\\n     Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,\\\\n     It\\'s fit this royal session do proceed;\\\\n     And that, without delay, their arguments\\\\n     Be now produced and heard.\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     Lord cardinal,\\\\n     To you I speak.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Your pleasure, madam?\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     Sir,\\\\n     I am about to weep; but, thinking that\\\\n     We are a queen, or long have dream\\'d so, certain\\\\n     The daughter of a king, my drops of tears\\\\n     I\\'ll turn to sparks of fire.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Be patient yet.\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     I will, when you are humble; nay, before,\\\\n     Or God will punish me.

Madam, you do me wrong:\\\\n     I have no spleen against you; nor injustice\\\\n     For you or any: how far I have proceeded,\\\\n     Or how far further shall, is warranted\\\\n     By a commission from the consistory,\\\\n     Yea, the whole consistory of Rome.

If he know\\\\n     That I am free of your report, he knows\\\\n     I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him\\\\n     It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to\\\\n     Remove these thoughts from you: the which before\\\\n     His highness shall speak in, I do beseech\\\\n     You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking\\\\n     And to say so no more.\\\\nQUEEN KATHARINE\\\\n     My lord, my lord,\\\\n     I am a simple woman, much too weak\\\\n     To oppose your cunning.

You are not to be taught\\\\n     That you have many enemies, that know not\\\\n     Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,\\\\n     Bark when their fellows do: by some of these\\\\n     The queen is put in anger. You\\'re excused:\\\\n     But will you be more justified? You ever\\\\n     Have wish\\'d the sleeping of this business; never desired\\\\n     It to be stirr\\'d; but oft have hinder\\'d, oft,\\\\n     The passages made toward it: on my honour,\\\\n     I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,\\\\n     And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to\\'t,\\\\n     I will be bold with time and your attention:\\\\n     Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to\\'t:\\\\n     My conscience first received a tenderness,\\\\n     Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter\\'d\\\\n     By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;\\\\n     Who had been hither sent on the debating\\\\n     A marriage \\'twixt the Duke of Orleans and\\\\n     Our daughter Mary: i\\' the progress of this business,\\\\n     Ere a determinate resolution, he,\\\\n     I mean the bishop, did require a respite;\\\\n     Wherein he might the king his lord advertise\\\\n     Whether our daughter were legitimate,\\\\n     Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,\\\\n     Sometimes our brother\\'s wife. This respite shook\\\\n     The bosom of my conscience, enter\\'d me,\\\\n     Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble\\\\n     The region of my breast; which forced such way,\\\\n     That many mazed considerings did throng\\\\n     And press\\'d in with this caution. First, methought\\\\n     I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had\\\\n     Commanded nature, that my lady\\'s womb,\\\\n     If it conceived a male child by me, should\\\\n     Do no more offices of life to\\'t than\\\\n     The grave does to the dead; for her male issue\\\\n     Or died where they were made, or shortly after\\\\n     This world had air\\'d them: hence I took a thought,\\\\n     This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,\\\\n     Well worthy the best heir o\\' the world, should not\\\\n     Be gladded in\\'t by me: then follows, that\\\\n     I weigh\\'d the danger which my realms stood in\\\\n     By this my issue\\'s fail; and that gave to me\\\\n     Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in\\\\n     The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer\\\\n     Toward this remedy, whereupon we are\\\\n     Now present here together: that\\'s to say,\\\\n     I meant to rectify my conscience,--which\\\\n     I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--\\\\n     By all the reverend fathers of the land\\\\n     And doctors learn\\'d: first I began in private\\\\n     With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember\\\\n     How under my oppression I did reek,\\\\n     When I first moved you.\\\\nLINCOLN\\\\n     Very well, my liege.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say\\\\n     How far you satisfied me.\\\\nLINCOLN\\\\n     So please your highness,\\\\n     The question did at first so stagger me,\\\\n     Bearing a state of mighty moment in\\'t\\\\n     And consequence of dread, that I committed\\\\n     The daring\\'st counsel which I had to doubt;\\\\n     And did entreat your highness to this course\\\\n     Which you are running here.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     I then moved you,\\\\n     My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave\\\\n     To make this present summons: unsolicited\\\\n     I left no reverend person in this court;\\\\n     But by particular consent proceeded\\\\n     Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:\\\\n     For no dislike i\\' the world against the person\\\\n     Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points\\\\n     Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:\\\\n     Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life\\\\n     And kingly dignity, we are contented\\\\n     To wear our mortal state to come with her,\\\\n     Katharine our queen, before the primest creature\\\\n     That\\'s paragon\\'d o\\' the world.\\\\nCARDINAL CAMPEIUS\\\\n     So please your highness,\\\\n     The queen being absent, \\'tis a needful fitness\\\\n     That we adjourn this court till further day:\\\\n     Meanwhile must be an earnest motion\\\\n     Made to the queen, to call back her appeal\\\\n     She intends unto his holiness.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     [Aside] I may perceive\\\\n     These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor\\\\n     This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.\\\\n     My learn\\'d and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,\\\\n     Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,\\\\n     My comfort comes along.

No, he\\'s settled,\\\\n     Not to come off, in his displeasure.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Sir,\\\\n     I should be glad to hear such news as this\\\\n     Once every hour.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Believe it, this is true:\\\\n     In the divorce his contrary proceedings\\\\n     Are all unfolded wherein he appears\\\\n     As I would wish mine enemy.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     How came\\\\n     His practises to light?\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     Most strangely.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     O, how, how?\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     The cardinal\\'s letters to the pope miscarried,\\\\n     And came to the eye o\\' the king: wherein was read,\\\\n     How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness\\\\n     To stay the judgment o\\' the divorce; for if\\\\n     It did take place, \\'I do,\\' quoth he, \\'perceive\\\\n     My king is tangled in affection to\\\\n     A creature of the queen\\'s, Lady Anne Bullen.\\'\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Has the king this?\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     Believe it.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Will this work?\\\\nChamberlain\\\\n     The king in this perceives him, how he coasts\\\\n     And hedges his own way. But in this point\\\\n     All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic\\\\n     After his patient\\'s death: the king already\\\\n     Hath married the fair lady.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Would he had!\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     May you be happy in your wish, my lord\\\\n     For, I profess, you have it.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Now, all my joy\\\\n     Trace the conjunction!\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     My amen to\\'t!\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     All men\\'s!\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     There\\'s order given for her coronation:\\\\n     Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left\\\\n     To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,\\\\n     She is a gallant creature, and complete\\\\n     In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her\\\\n     Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall\\\\n     In it be memorised.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     But, will the king\\\\n     Digest this letter of the cardinal\\'s?\\\\n     The Lord forbid!\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Marry, amen!\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     No, no;\\\\n     There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose\\\\n     Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius\\\\n     Is stol\\'n away to Rome; hath ta\\'en no leave;\\\\n     Has left the cause o\\' the king unhandled; and\\\\n     Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,\\\\n     To second all his plot. I do assure you\\\\n     The king cried Ha! at this.\\\\nChamberlain\\\\n     Now, God incense him,\\\\n     And let him cry Ha! louder!\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     But, my lord,\\\\n     When returns Cranmer?\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     He is return\\'d in his opinions; which\\\\n     Have satisfied the king for his divorce,\\\\n     Together with all famous colleges\\\\n     Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,\\\\n     His second marriage shall be publish\\'d, and\\\\n     Her coronation. Katharine no more\\\\n     Shall be call\\'d queen, but princess dowager\\\\n     And widow to Prince Arthur.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     This same Cranmer\\'s\\\\n     A worthy fellow, and hath ta\\'en much pain\\\\n     In the king\\'s business.\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     He has; and we shall see him\\\\n     For it an archbishop.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     So I hear.\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     \\'Tis so.\\\\n     The cardinal!\\\\n     Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Observe, observe, he\\'s moody.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     The packet, Cromwell.\\\\n     Gave\\'t you the king?\\\\nCROMWELL\\\\n     To his own hand, in\\'s bedchamber.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Look\\'d he o\\' the inside of the paper?\\\\nCROMWELL\\\\n     Presently\\\\n     He did unseal them: and the first he view\\'d,\\\\n     He did it with a serious mind; a heed\\\\n     Was in his countenance.

What though I know her virtuous\\\\n     And well deserving? yet I know her for\\\\n     A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to\\\\n     Our cause, that she should lie i\\' the bosom of\\\\n     Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up\\\\n     An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one\\\\n     Hath crawl\\'d into the favour of the king,\\\\n     And is his oracle.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     He is vex\\'d at something.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     I would \\'twere something that would fret the string,\\\\n     The master-cord on\\'s heart!\\\\n     Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     The king, the king!\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     What piles of wealth hath he accumulated\\\\n     To his own portion! and what expense by the hour\\\\n     Seems to flow from him! How, i\\' the name of thrift,\\\\n     Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,\\\\n     Saw you the cardinal?\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     My lord, we have\\\\n     Stood here observing him: some strange commotion\\\\n     Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;\\\\n     Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,\\\\n     Then lays his finger on his temple, straight\\\\n     Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,\\\\n     Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts\\\\n     His eye against the moon: in most strange postures\\\\n     We have seen him set himself.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     It may well be;\\\\n     There is a mutiny in\\'s mind. This morning\\\\n     Papers of state he sent me to peruse,\\\\n     As I required: and wot you what I found\\\\n     There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?\\\\n     Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;\\\\n     The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,\\\\n     Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which\\\\n     I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks\\\\n     Possession of a subject.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     It\\'s heaven\\'s will:\\\\n     Some spirit put this paper in the packet,\\\\n     To bless your eye withal.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     If we did think\\\\n     His contemplation were above the earth,\\\\n     And fix\\'d on spiritual object, he should still\\\\n     Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid\\\\n     His thinkings are below the moon, not worth\\\\n     His serious considering.\\\\n     King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL, who goes to CARDINAL\\\\n     WOLSEY\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Heaven forgive me!\\\\n     Ever God bless your highness!\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Good my lord,\\\\n     You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory\\\\n     Of your best graces in your mind; the which\\\\n     You were now running o\\'er: you have scarce time\\\\n     To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span\\\\n     To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that\\\\n     I deem you an ill husband, and am glad\\\\n     To have you therein my companion.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Sir,\\\\n     For holy offices I have a time; a time\\\\n     To think upon the part of business which\\\\n     I bear i\\' the state; and nature does require\\\\n     Her times of preservation, which perforce\\\\n     I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,\\\\n     Must give my tendence to.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     You have said well.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     And ever may your highness yoke together,\\\\n     As I will lend you cause, my doing well\\\\n     With my well saying!\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     \\'Tis well said again;\\\\n     And \\'tis a kind of good deed to say well:\\\\n     And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:\\\\n     His said he did; and with his deed did crown\\\\n     His word upon you. Since I had my office,\\\\n     I have kept you next my heart; have not alone\\\\n     Employ\\'d you where high profits might come home,\\\\n     But pared my present havings, to bestow\\\\n     My bounties upon you.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     [Aside] What should this mean?\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     [Aside] The Lord increase this business!\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Have I not made you,\\\\n     The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,\\\\n     If what I now pronounce you have found true:\\\\n     And, if you may confess it, say withal,\\\\n     If you are bound to us or no. What say you?\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,\\\\n     Shower\\'d on me daily, have been more than could\\\\n     My studied purposes requite; which went\\\\n     Beyond all man\\'s endeavours: my endeavours\\\\n     Have ever come too short of my desires,\\\\n     Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends\\\\n     Have been mine so that evermore they pointed\\\\n     To the good of your most sacred person and\\\\n     The profit of the state. For your great graces\\\\n     Heap\\'d upon me, poor undeserver, I\\\\n     Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,\\\\n     My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,\\\\n     Which ever has and ever shall be growing,\\\\n     Till death, that winter, kill it.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Fairly answer\\'d;\\\\n     A loyal and obedient subject is\\\\n     Therein illustrated: the honour of it\\\\n     Does pay the act of it; as, i\\' the contrary,\\\\n     The foulness is the punishment. I presume\\\\n     That, as my hand has open\\'d bounty to you,\\\\n     My heart dropp\\'d love, my power rain\\'d honour, more\\\\n     On you than any; so your hand and heart,\\\\n     Your brain, and every function of your power,\\\\n     Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,\\\\n     As \\'twere in love\\'s particular, be more\\\\n     To me, your friend, than any.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     I do profess\\\\n     That for your highness\\' good I ever labour\\'d\\\\n     More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--\\\\n     Though all the world should crack their duty to you,\\\\n     And throw it from their soul; though perils did\\\\n     Abound, as thick as thought could make \\'em, and\\\\n     Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,\\\\n     As doth a rock against the chiding flood,\\\\n     Should the approach of this wild river break,\\\\n     And stand unshaken yours.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     \\'Tis nobly spoken:\\\\n     Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,\\\\n     For you have seen him open\\'t. Read o\\'er this;\\\\n     Giving him papers\\\\n     And after, this: and then to breakfast with\\\\n     What appetite you have.\\\\n     Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the Nobles\\\\n     throng after him, smiling and whispering\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     What should this mean?\\\\n     What sudden anger\\'s this? how have I reap\\'d it?\\\\n     He parted frowning from me, as if ruin\\\\n     Leap\\'d from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion\\\\n     Upon the daring huntsman that has gall\\'d him;\\\\n     Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;\\\\n     I fear, the story of his anger. \\'Tis so;\\\\n     This paper has undone me: \\'tis the account\\\\n     Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together\\\\n     For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,\\\\n     And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!\\\\n     Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil\\\\n     Made me put this main secret in the packet\\\\n     I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?\\\\n     No new device to beat this from his brains?\\\\n     I know \\'twill stir him strongly; yet I know\\\\n     A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune\\\\n     Will bring me off again. What\\'s this? \\'To the Pope!\\'\\\\n     The letter, as I live, with all the business\\\\n     I writ to\\'s holiness. Nay then, farewell!\\\\n     I have touch\\'d the highest point of all my greatness;\\\\n     And, from that full meridian of my glory,\\\\n     I haste now to my setting: I shall fall\\\\n     Like a bright exhalation m the evening,\\\\n     And no man see me more.\\\\n     Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY, and the\\\\n     Chamberlain\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Hear the king\\'s pleasure, cardinal: who commands you\\\\n     To render up the great seal presently\\\\n     Into our hands; and to confine yourself\\\\n     To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester\\'s,\\\\n     Till you hear further from his highness.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Stay:\\\\n     Where\\'s your commission, lords? words cannot carry\\\\n     Authority so weighty.\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     Who dare cross \\'em,\\\\n     Bearing the king\\'s will from his mouth expressly?\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Till I find more than will or words to do it,\\\\n     I mean your malice, know, officious lords,\\\\n     I dare and must deny it. Now I feel\\\\n     Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:\\\\n     How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,\\\\n     As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton\\\\n     Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!\\\\n     Follow your envious courses, men of malice;\\\\n     You have Christian warrant for \\'em, and, no doubt,\\\\n     In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,\\\\n     You ask with such a violence, the king,\\\\n     Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;\\\\n     Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,\\\\n     During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,\\\\n     Tied it by letters-patents: now, who\\'ll take it?\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     The king, that gave it.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     It must be himself, then.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Thou art a proud traitor, priest.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Proud lord, thou liest:\\\\n     Within these forty hours Surrey durst better\\\\n     Have burnt that tongue than said so.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Thy ambition,\\\\n     Thou scarlet sin, robb\\'d this bewailing land\\\\n     Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:\\\\n     The heads of all thy brother cardinals,\\\\n     With thee and all thy best parts bound together,\\\\n     Weigh\\'d not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!\\\\n     You sent me deputy for Ireland;\\\\n     Far from his succor, from the king, from all\\\\n     That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;\\\\n     Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,\\\\n     Absolved him with an axe.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     This, and all else\\\\n     This talking lord can lay upon my credit,\\\\n     I answer is most false. The duke by law\\\\n     Found his deserts: how innocent I was\\\\n     From any private malice in his end,\\\\n     His noble jury and foul cause can witness.\\\\n     If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you\\\\n     You have as little honesty as honour,\\\\n     That in the way of loyalty and truth\\\\n     Toward the king, my ever royal master,\\\\n     Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,\\\\n     And all that love his follies.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     By my soul,\\\\n     Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou\\\\n     shouldst feel\\\\n     My sword i\\' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,\\\\n     Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?\\\\n     And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,\\\\n     To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,\\\\n     Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,\\\\n     And dare us with his cap like larks.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     All goodness\\\\n     Is poison to thy stomach.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Yes, that goodness\\\\n     Of gleaning all the land\\'s wealth into one,\\\\n     Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;\\\\n     The goodness of your intercepted packets\\\\n     You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,\\\\n     Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.\\\\n     My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,\\\\n     As you respect the common good, the state\\\\n     Of our despised nobility, our issues,\\\\n     Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,\\\\n     Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles\\\\n     Collected from his life. I\\'ll startle you\\\\n     Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench\\\\n     Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     How much, methinks, I could despise this man,\\\\n     But that I am bound in charity against it!\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Those articles, my lord, are in the king\\'s hand:\\\\n     But, thus much, they are foul ones.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     So much fairer\\\\n     And spotless shall mine innocence arise,\\\\n     When the king knows my truth.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     This cannot save you:\\\\n     I thank my memory, I yet remember\\\\n     Some of these articles; and out they shall.\\\\n     Now, if you can blush and cry \\'guilty,\\' cardinal,\\\\n     You\\'ll show a little honesty.\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     Speak on, sir;\\\\n     I dare your worst objections: if I blush,\\\\n     It is to see a nobleman want manners.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!\\\\n     First, that, without the king\\'s assent or knowledge,\\\\n     You wrought to be a legate; by which power\\\\n     You maim\\'d the jurisdiction of all bishops.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else\\\\n     To foreign princes, \\'Ego et Rex meus\\'\\\\n     Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king\\\\n     To be your servant.\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     Then that, without the knowledge\\\\n     Either of king or council, when you went\\\\n     Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold\\\\n     To carry into Flanders the great seal.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Item, you sent a large commission\\\\n     To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,\\\\n     Without the king\\'s will or the state\\'s allowance,\\\\n     A league between his highness and Ferrara.\\\\nSUFFOLK\\\\n     That, out of mere ambition, you have caused\\\\n     Your holy hat to be stamp\\'d on the king\\'s coin.\\\\nSURREY\\\\n     Then that you have sent innumerable substance--\\\\n     By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--\\\\n     To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways\\\\n     You have for dignities; to the mere undoing\\\\n     Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;\\\\n     Which, since they are of you, and odious,\\\\n     I will not taint my mouth with.\\\\nChamberlain\\\\n     O my lord,\\\\n     Press not a falling man too far! \\'tis virtue:\\\\n     His faults lie open to the laws; let them,\\\\n     Not you, correct him.

This is my charge.\\\\nNORFOLK\\\\n     And so we\\'ll leave you to your meditations\\\\n     How to live better. For your stubborn answer\\\\n     About the giving back the great seal to us,\\\\n     The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.\\\\n     So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.\\\\n     Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\nCARDINAL WOLSEY\\\\n     So farewell to the little good you bear me.\\\\n     Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!\\\\n     This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\\\\n     The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\\\\n     And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;\\\\n     The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\\\\n     And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\\\\n     His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\\\\n     And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\\\\n     Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\\\\n     This many summers in a sea of glory,\\\\n     But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\\\\n     At length broke under me and now has left me,\\\\n     Weary and old with service, to the mercy\\\\n     Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.\\\\n     Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\\\\n     I feel my heart new open\\'d.

At our last encounter,\\\\n     The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     \\'Tis very true: but that time offer\\'d sorrow;\\\\n     This, general joy.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     \\'Tis well: the citizens,\\\\n     I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--\\\\n     As, let \\'em have their rights, they are ever forward--\\\\n     In celebration of this day with shows,\\\\n     Pageants and sights of honour.\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     Never greater,\\\\n     Nor, I\\'ll assure you, better taken, sir.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     May I be bold to ask at what that contains,\\\\n     That paper in your hand?\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     Yes; \\'tis the list\\\\n     Of those that claim their offices this day\\\\n     By custom of the coronation.\\\\n     The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims\\\\n     To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,\\\\n     He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,\\\\n     I should have been beholding to your paper.\\\\n     But, I beseech you, what\\'s become of Katharine,\\\\n     The princess dowager? how goes her business?\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     That I can tell you too. The Archbishop\\\\n     Of Canterbury, accompanied with other\\\\n     Learned and reverend fathers of his order,\\\\n     Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off\\\\n     From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which\\\\n     She was often cited by them, but appear\\'d not:\\\\n     And, to be short, for not appearance and\\\\n     The king\\'s late scruple, by the main assent\\\\n     Of all these learned men she was divorced,\\\\n     And the late marriage made of none effect\\\\n     Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,\\\\n     Where she remains now sick.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     Alas, good lady!\\\\n     Trumpets\\\\n     The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.\\\\n     Hautboys\\\\n     THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION\\\\n     1.

Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then\\\\n     Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his\\\\n     head a gilt copper crown.\\\\n     6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,\\\\n     on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With\\\\n     him, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with\\\\n     the dove, crowned with an earl\\'s coronet.\\\\n     Collars of SS.\\\\n     7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet\\\\n     on his head, bearing a long white wand, as\\\\n     high-steward.

A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;\\\\n     under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair\\\\n     richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each\\\\n     side her, the Bishops of London and\\\\n     Winchester.\\\\n     9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of\\\\n     gold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEEN\\\\n     ANNE\\'s train.\\\\n     10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain\\\\n     circlets of gold without flowers.\\\\n     They pass over the stage in order and state\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     A royal train, believe me.

These are stars indeed;\\\\n     And sometimes falling ones.\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     No more of that.\\\\n     Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets\\\\n     Enter a third Gentleman\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     Among the crowd i\\' the Abbey; where a finger\\\\n     Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled\\\\n     With the mere rankness of their joy.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     You saw\\\\n     The ceremony?\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     That I did.\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     How was it?\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     Well worth the seeing.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     Good sir, speak it to us.\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     As well as I am able. The rich stream\\\\n     Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen\\\\n     To a prepared place in the choir, fell off\\\\n     A distance from her; while her grace sat down\\\\n     To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,\\\\n     In a rich chair of state, opposing freely\\\\n     The beauty of her person to the people.\\\\n     Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman\\\\n     That ever lay by man: which when the people\\\\n     Had the full view of, such a noise arose\\\\n     As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,\\\\n     As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--\\\\n     Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces\\\\n     Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy\\\\n     I never saw before. Great-bellied women,\\\\n     That had not half a week to go, like rams\\\\n     In the old time of war, would shake the press,\\\\n     And make \\'em reel before \\'em. No man living\\\\n     Could say \\'This is my wife\\' there; all were woven\\\\n     So strangely in one piece.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     But, what follow\\'d?\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     At length her grace rose, and with modest paces\\\\n     Came to the altar; where she kneel\\'d, and saint-like\\\\n     Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray\\'d devoutly.\\\\n     Then rose again and bow\\'d her to the people:\\\\n     When by the Archbishop of Canterbury\\\\n     She had all the royal makings of a queen;\\\\n     As holy oil, Edward Confessor\\'s crown,\\\\n     The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems\\\\n     Laid nobly on her: which perform\\'d, the choir,\\\\n     With all the choicest music of the kingdom,\\\\n     Together sung \\'Te Deum.\\' So she parted,\\\\n     And with the same full state paced back again\\\\n     To York-place, where the feast is held.\\\\nFirst Gentleman\\\\n     Sir,\\\\n     You must no more call it York-place, that\\'s past;\\\\n     For, since the cardinal fell, that title\\'s lost:\\\\n     \\'Tis now the king\\'s, and call\\'d Whitehall.\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     I know it;\\\\n     But \\'tis so lately alter\\'d, that the old name\\\\n     Is fresh about me.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     What two reverend bishops\\\\n     Were those that went on each side of the queen?\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,\\\\n     Newly preferr\\'d from the king\\'s secretary,\\\\n     The other, London.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     He of Winchester\\\\n     Is held no great good lover of the archbishop\\'s,\\\\n     The virtuous Cranmer.\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     All the land knows that:\\\\n     However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,\\\\n     Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     Who may that be, I pray you?\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     Thomas Cromwell;\\\\n     A man in much esteem with the king, and truly\\\\n     A worthy friend. The king has made him master\\\\n     O\\' the jewel house,\\\\n     And one, already, of the privy council.\\\\nSecond Gentleman\\\\n     He will deserve more.\\\\nThird Gentleman\\\\n     Yes, without all doubt.\\\\n     Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which\\\\n     Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:\\\\n     Something I can command.

Reach a chair:\\\\n     So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.\\\\n     Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led\\'st me,\\\\n     That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?\\\\nGRIFFITH\\\\n     Yes, madam; but I think your grace,\\\\n     Out of the pain you suffer\\'d, gave no ear to\\'t.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:\\\\n     If well, he stepp\\'d before me, happily\\\\n     For my example.\\\\nGRIFFITH\\\\n     Well, the voice goes, madam:\\\\n     For after the stout Earl Northumberland\\\\n     Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,\\\\n     As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,\\\\n     He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill\\\\n     He could not sit his mule.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     Alas, poor man!\\\\nGRIFFITH\\\\n     At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,\\\\n     Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,\\\\n     With all his covent, honourably received him;\\\\n     To whom he gave these words, \\'O, father abbot,\\\\n     An old man, broken with the storms of state,\\\\n     Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;\\\\n     Give him a little earth for charity!\\'\\\\n     So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness\\\\n     Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,\\\\n     About the hour of eight, which he himself\\\\n     Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,\\\\n     Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,\\\\n     He gave his honours to the world again,\\\\n     His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.\\\\nKATHARINE\\\\n     So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!\\\\n     Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,\\\\n     And yet with charity. He was a man\\\\n     Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking\\\\n     Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,\\\\n     Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;\\\\n     His own opinion was his law: i\\' the presence\\\\n     He would say untruths; and be ever double\\\\n     Both in his words and meaning: he was never,\\\\n     But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:\\\\n     His promises were, as he then was, mighty;\\\\n     But his performance, as he is now, nothing:\\\\n     Of his own body he was ill, and gave\\\\n     The clergy in example.\\\\nGRIFFITH\\\\n     Noble madam,\\\\n     Men\\'s evil manners live in brass; their virtues\\\\n     We write in water.

My Lord of\\\\n     Canterbury,\\\\n     I have a suit which you must not deny me;\\\\n     That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,\\\\n     You must be godfather, and answer for her.\\\\nCRANMER\\\\n     The greatest monarch now alive may glory\\\\n     In such an honour: how may I deserve it\\\\n     That am a poor and humble subject to you?\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Come, come, my lord, you\\'ld spare your spoons: you\\\\n     shall have two noble partners with you; the old\\\\n     Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will\\\\n     these please you?\\\\n     Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,\\\\n     Embrace and love this man.\\\\nGARDINER\\\\n     With a true heart\\\\n     And brother-love I do it.\\\\nCRANMER\\\\n     And let heaven\\\\n     Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.\\\\nKING HENRY VIII\\\\n     Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:\\\\n     The common voice, I see, is verified\\\\n     Of thee, which says thus, \\'Do my Lord of Canterbury\\\\n     A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.\\'\\\\n     Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long\\\\n     To have this young one made a Christian.\\\\n     As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;\\\\n     So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.\\\\n     Exeunt\\\\n**** SCENE IV. The palace yard. ****\\\\n     Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man\\\\nPorter\\\\n     You\\'ll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you\\\\n     take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,\\\\n     leave your gaping.\\\\n     Within\\\\n     Good master porter, I belong to the larder.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is\\\\n     this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree\\\\n     staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to\\\\n     \\'em. I\\'ll scratch your heads: you must be seeing\\\\n     christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,\\\\n     you rude rascals?\\\\nMan\\\\n     Pray, sir, be patient: \\'tis as much impossible--\\\\n     Unless we sweep \\'em from the door with cannons--\\\\n     To scatter \\'em, as \\'tis to make \\'em sleep\\\\n     On May-day morning; which will never be:\\\\n     We may as well push against Powle\\'s, as stir em.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     How got they in, and be hang\\'d?\\\\nMan\\\\n     Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?\\\\n     As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--\\\\n     You see the poor remainder--could distribute,\\\\n     I made no spare, sir.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     You did nothing, sir.\\\\nMan\\\\n     I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,\\\\n     To mow \\'em down before me: but if I spared any\\\\n     That had a head to hit, either young or old,\\\\n     He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,\\\\n     Let me ne\\'er hope to see a chine again\\\\n     And that I would not for a cow, God save her!\\\\n     Within\\\\n     Do you hear, master porter?\\\\nPorter\\\\n     I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.\\\\n     Keep the door close, sirrah.\\\\nMan\\\\n     What would you have me do?\\\\nPorter\\\\n     What should you do, but knock \\'em down by the\\\\n     dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have\\\\n     we some strange Indian with the great tool come to\\\\n     court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a\\\\n     fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian\\\\n     conscience, this one christening will beget a\\\\n     thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.\\\\nMan\\\\n     The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a\\\\n     fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a\\\\n     brazier by his face, for, o\\' my conscience, twenty\\\\n     of the dog-days now reign in\\'s nose; all that stand\\\\n     about him are under the line, they need no other\\\\n     penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on\\\\n     the head, and three times was his nose discharged\\\\n     against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to\\\\n     blow us. There was a haberdasher\\'s wife of small\\\\n     wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked\\\\n     porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a\\\\n     combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,\\\\n     and hit that woman; who cried out \\'Clubs!\\' when I\\\\n     might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to\\\\n     her succor, which were the hope o\\' the Strand, where\\\\n     she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my\\\\n     place: at length they came to the broom-staff to\\\\n     me; I defied \\'em still: when suddenly a file of\\\\n     boys behind \\'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower\\\\n     of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,\\\\n     and let \\'em win the work: the devil was amongst\\\\n     \\'em, I think, surely.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,\\\\n     and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but\\\\n     the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of\\\\n     Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.\\\\n     I have some of \\'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they\\\\n     are like to dance these three days; besides the\\\\n     running banquet of two beadles that is to come.\\\\n     Enter Chamberlain\\\\nChamberlain\\\\n     Mercy o\\' me, what a multitude are here!\\\\n     They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,\\\\n     As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,\\\\n     These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:\\\\n     There\\'s a trim rabble let in: are all these\\\\n     Your faithful friends o\\' the suburbs? We shall have\\\\n     Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,\\\\n     When they pass back from the christening.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     An\\'t please\\\\n     your honour,\\\\n     We are but men; and what so many may do,\\\\n     Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:\\\\n     An army cannot rule \\'em.\\\\nChamberlain\\\\n     As I live,\\\\n     If the king blame me for\\'t, I\\'ll lay ye all\\\\n     By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads\\\\n     Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;\\\\n     And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when\\\\n     Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;\\\\n     They\\'re come already from the christening:\\\\n     Go, break among the press, and find a way out\\\\n     To let the troop pass fairly; or I\\'ll find\\\\n     A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     Make way there for the princess.\\\\nMan\\\\n     You great fellow,\\\\n     Stand close up, or I\\'ll make your head ache.\\\\nPorter\\\\n     You i\\' the camlet, get up o\\' the rail;\\\\n     I\\'ll peck you o\\'er the pales else.\\\\n     Exeunt\\\\n**** SCENE V.
