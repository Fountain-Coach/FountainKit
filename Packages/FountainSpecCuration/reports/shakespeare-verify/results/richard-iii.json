As we paced along\\\\n     Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\\\\n     Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,\\\\n     Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\\\\n     Into the tumbling billows of the main.\\\\n     Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!\\\\n     What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\\\\n     What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\\\\n     Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\\\\n     Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw\\'d upon;\\\\n     Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\\\\n     Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\\\\n     All scatter\\'d in the bottom of the sea:\\\\n     Some lay in dead men\\'s skulls; and, in those holes\\\\n     Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\\\\n     As \\'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\\\\n     Which woo\\'d the slimy bottom of the deep,\\\\n     And mock\\'d the dead bones that lay scatter\\'d by.\\\\nBRAKENBURY\\\\n     Had you such leisure in the time of death\\\\n     To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?\\\\nCLARENCE\\\\n     Methought I had; and often did I strive\\\\n     To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\\\\n     Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth\\\\n     To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;\\\\n     But smother\\'d it within my panting bulk,\\\\n     Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.\\\\nBRAKENBURY\\\\n     Awaked you not with this sore agony?\\\\nCLARENCE\\\\n     O, no, my dream was lengthen\\'d after life;\\\\n     O, then began the tempest to my soul,\\\\n     Who pass\\'d, methought, the melancholy flood,\\\\n     With that grim ferryman which poets write of,\\\\n     Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\\\\n     The first that there did greet my stranger soul,\\\\n     Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;\\\\n     Who cried aloud, \\'What scourge for perjury\\\\n     Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?\\'\\\\n     And so he vanish\\'d: then came wandering by\\\\n     A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\\\\n     Dabbled in blood; and he squeak\\'d out aloud,\\\\n     \\'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,\\\\n     That stabb\\'d me in the field by Tewksbury;\\\\n     Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!\\'\\\\n     With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\\\\n     Environ\\'d me about, and howled in mine ears\\\\n     Such hideous cries, that with the very noise\\\\n     I trembling waked, and for a season after\\\\n     Could not believe but that I was in hell,\\\\n     Such terrible impression made the dream.\\\\nBRAKENBURY\\\\n     No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;\\\\n     I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.\\\\nCLARENCE\\\\n     O Brakenbury, I have done those things,\\\\n     Which now bear evidence against my soul,\\\\n     For Edward\\'s sake; and see how he requites me!\\\\n     O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,\\\\n     But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\\\\n     Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,\\\\n     O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\\\\n     I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\\\\n     My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\\\\nBRAKENBURY\\\\n     I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!\\\\n     CLARENCE sleeps\\\\n     Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\\\\n     Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.\\\\n     Princes have but their tides for their glories,\\\\n     An outward honour for an inward toil;\\\\n     And, for unfelt imagination,\\\\n     They often feel a world of restless cares:\\\\n     So that, betwixt their tides and low names,\\\\n     There\\'s nothing differs but the outward fame.\\\\n     Enter the two Murderers\\\\nFirst Murderer\\\\n     Ho! who\\'s here?\\\\nBRAKENBURY\\\\n     In God\\'s name what are you, and how came you hither?\\\\nFirst Murderer\\\\n     I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.\\\\nBRAKENBURY\\\\n     Yea, are you so brief?\\\\nSecond Murderer\\\\n     O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious.

If drawing my sword against the humour\\\\n     of affection would deliver me from the reprobate\\\\n     thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and\\\\n     ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised\\\\n     courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should\\\\n     outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men\\\\n     have been in love?\\\\nMOTH\\\\n     Hercules, master.\\\\n     DON\\\\nADRIANO DE ARMADO\\\\n     Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name\\\\n     more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good\\\\n     repute and carriage.\\\\nMOTH\\\\n     Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great\\\\n     carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back\\\\n     like a porter: and he was in love.\\\\n     DON\\\\nADRIANO DE ARMADO\\\\n     O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson!

I shall be forsworn, which\\\\n     is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And\\\\n     how can that be true love which is falsely\\\\n     attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:\\\\n     there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so\\\\n     tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was\\\\n     Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.\\\\n     Cupid\\'s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules\\' club;\\\\n     and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard\\'s rapier.\\\\n     The first and second cause will not serve my turn;\\\\n     the passado he respects not, the duello he regards\\\\n     not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his\\\\n     glory is to subdue men.

Come, thou\\\\n     mortal wretch,\\\\n     To an asp, which she applies to her breast\\\\n     With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\\\\n     Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool\\\\n     Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,\\\\n     That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass\\\\n     Unpolicied!\\\\nCHARMIAN\\\\n     O eastern star!\\\\nCLEOPATRA\\\\n     Peace, peace!\\\\n     Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,\\\\n     That sucks the nurse asleep?\\\\nCHARMIAN\\\\n     O, break! O, break!\\\\nCLEOPATRA\\\\n     As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--\\\\n     O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.\\\\n     Applying another asp to her arm\\\\n     What should I stay--\\\\n     Dies\\\\nCHARMIAN\\\\n     In this vile world? So, fare thee well.\\\\n     Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies\\\\n     A lass unparallel\\'d. Downy windows, close;\\\\n     And golden Phoebus never be beheld\\\\n     Of eyes again so royal! Your crown\\'s awry;\\\\n     I\\'ll mend it, and then play.\\\\n     Enter the Guard, rushing in\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     Where is the queen?\\\\nCHARMIAN\\\\n     Speak softly, wake her not.\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     Caesar hath sent--\\\\nCHARMIAN\\\\n     Too slow a messenger.\\\\n     Applies an asp\\\\n     O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     Approach, ho! All\\'s not well: Caesar\\'s beguiled.\\\\nSecond Guard\\\\n     There\\'s Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?\\\\nCHARMIAN\\\\n     It is well done, and fitting for a princess\\\\n     Descended of so many royal kings.\\\\n     Ah, soldier!\\\\n     Dies\\\\n     Re-enter DOLABELLA\\\\nDOLABELLA\\\\n     How goes it here?\\\\nSecond Guard\\\\n     All dead.\\\\nDOLABELLA\\\\n     Caesar, thy thoughts\\\\n     Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming\\\\n     To see perform\\'d the dreaded act which thou\\\\n     So sought\\'st to hinder.\\\\n     Within \\'A way there, a way for Caesar!\\'\\\\n     Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching\\\\nDOLABELLA\\\\n     O sir, you are too sure an augurer;\\\\n     That you did fear is done.\\\\nOCTAVIUS CAESAR\\\\n     Bravest at the last,\\\\n     She levell\\'d at our purposes, and, being royal,\\\\n     Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?\\\\n     I do not see them bleed.\\\\nDOLABELLA\\\\n     Who was last with them?\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     A simple countryman, that brought her figs:\\\\n     This was his basket.\\\\nOCTAVIUS CAESAR\\\\n     Poison\\'d, then.\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     O Caesar,\\\\n     This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:\\\\n     I found her trimming up the diadem\\\\n     On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood\\\\n     And on the sudden dropp\\'d.\\\\nOCTAVIUS CAESAR\\\\n     O noble weakness!\\\\n     If they had swallow\\'d poison, \\'twould appear\\\\n     By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,\\\\n     As she would catch another Antony\\\\n     In her strong toil of grace.\\\\nDOLABELLA\\\\n     Here, on her breast,\\\\n     There is a vent of blood and something blown:\\\\n     The like is on her arm.\\\\nFirst Guard\\\\n     This is an aspic\\'s trail: and these fig-leaves\\\\n     Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves\\\\n     Upon the caves of Nile.\\\\nOCTAVIUS CAESAR\\\\n     Most probable\\\\n     That so she died; for her physician tells me\\\\n     She hath pursued conclusions infinite\\\\n     Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;\\\\n     And bear her women from the monument:\\\\n     She shall be buried by her Antony:\\\\n     No grave upon the earth shall clip in it\\\\n     A pair so famous. High events as these\\\\n     Strike those that make them; and their story is\\\\n     No less in pity than his glory which\\\\n     Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall\\\\n     In solemn show attend this funeral;\\\\n     And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see\\\\n     High order in this great solemnity.\\\\n     Exeunt\"}, \"canonical\": [{\"name\": \"MIT\", \"url\": \"https://shakespeare.mit.edu/richardiii/full.html\"}, {\"name\": \"Folger\", \"url\": \"https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeare-plays/richard-iii/\"}], \"options\": {\"shingleSize\": 3, \"maxExamples\": 5, \"minLineLen\": 20}}']' returned non-zero exit status 7."
