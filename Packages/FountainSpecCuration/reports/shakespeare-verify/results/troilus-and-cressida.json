He that will\\\\n     have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Have I not tarried?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry\\\\n     the bolting.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Have I not tarried?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Still have I tarried.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Ay, to the leavening; but here\\'s yet in the word\\\\n     \\'hereafter\\' the kneading, the making of the cake, the\\\\n     heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must\\\\n     stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Patience herself, what goddess e\\'er she be,\\\\n     Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.\\\\n     At Priam\\'s royal table do I sit;\\\\n     And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--\\\\n     So, traitor! \\'When she comes!\\' When is she thence?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw\\\\n     her look, or any woman else.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,\\\\n     As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,\\\\n     Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,\\\\n     I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,\\\\n     Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:\\\\n     But sorrow, that is couch\\'d in seeming gladness,\\\\n     Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen\\'s--\\\\n     well, go to--there were no more comparison between\\\\n     the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I\\\\n     would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would\\\\n     somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I\\\\n     will not dispraise your sister Cassandra\\'s wit, but--\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--\\\\n     When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown\\'d,\\\\n     Reply not in how many fathoms deep\\\\n     They lie indrench\\'d. I tell thee I am mad\\\\n     In Cressid\\'s love: thou answer\\'st \\'she is fair;\\'\\\\n     Pour\\'st in the open ulcer of my heart\\\\n     Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,\\\\n     Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,\\\\n     In whose comparison all whites are ink,\\\\n     Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure\\\\n     The cygnet\\'s down is harsh and spirit of sense\\\\n     Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell\\'st me,\\\\n     As true thou tell\\'st me, when I say I love her;\\\\n     But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,\\\\n     Thou lay\\'st in every gash that love hath given me\\\\n     The knife that made it.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     I speak no more than truth.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Thou dost not speak so much.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Faith, I\\'ll not meddle in\\'t. Let her be as she is:\\\\n     if she be fair, \\'tis the better for her; an she be\\\\n     not, she has the mends in her own hands.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of\\\\n     her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and\\\\n     between, but small thanks for my labour.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Because she\\'s kin to me, therefore she\\'s not so fair\\\\n     as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as\\\\n     fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care\\\\n     I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; \\'tis all one to me.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Say I she is not fair?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     I do not care whether you do or no. She\\'s a fool to\\\\n     stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so\\\\n     I\\'ll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,\\\\n     I\\'ll meddle nor make no more i\\' the matter.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Pandarus,--\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Not I.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Sweet Pandarus,--\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I\\\\n     found it, and there an end.\\\\n     Exit PANDARUS. An alarum\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!\\\\n     Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,\\\\n     When with your blood you daily paint her thus.\\\\n     I cannot fight upon this argument;\\\\n     It is too starved a subject for my sword.\\\\n     But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!\\\\n     I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;\\\\n     And he\\'s as tetchy to be woo\\'d to woo.\\\\n     As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.\\\\n     Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne\\'s love,\\\\n     What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?\\\\n     Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:\\\\n     Between our Ilium and where she resides,\\\\n     Let it be call\\'d the wild and wandering flood,\\\\n     Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar\\\\n     Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.\\\\n     Alarum.

A street. ****\\\\n     Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Who were those went by?\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     Queen Hecuba and Helen.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     And whither go they?\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     Up to the eastern tower,\\\\n     Whose height commands as subject all the vale,\\\\n     To see the battle. Hector, whose patience\\\\n     Is, as a virtue, fix\\'d, to-day was moved:\\\\n     He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,\\\\n     And, like as there were husbandry in war,\\\\n     Before the sun rose he was harness\\'d light,\\\\n     And to the field goes he; where every flower\\\\n     Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw\\\\n     In Hector\\'s wrath.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     What was his cause of anger?\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks\\\\n     A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;\\\\n     They call him Ajax.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Good; and what of him?\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     They say he is a very man per se,\\\\n     And stands alone.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their\\\\n     particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,\\\\n     churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man\\\\n     into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his\\\\n     valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with\\\\n     discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he\\\\n     hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he\\\\n     carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without\\\\n     cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the\\\\n     joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint\\\\n     that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,\\\\n     or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     But how should this man, that makes\\\\n     me smile, make Hector angry?\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and\\\\n     struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath\\\\n     ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Who comes here?\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     Madam, your uncle Pandarus.\\\\n     Enter PANDARUS\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Hector\\'s a gallant man.\\\\nALEXANDER\\\\n     As may be in the world, lady.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     What\\'s that? what\\'s that?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?\\\\n     Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When\\\\n     were you at Ilium?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     This morning, uncle.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector\\\\n     armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not\\\\n     up, was she?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Even so: Hector was stirring early.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     That were we talking of, and of his anger.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Was he angry?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     So he says here.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     True, he was so: I know the cause too: he\\'ll lay\\\\n     about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there\\'s\\\\n     Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take\\\\n     heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     What, is he angry too?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     O Jupiter! there\\'s no comparison.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a\\\\n     man if you see him?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     \\'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     So he is.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     He is not Hector.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Himself! no, he\\'s not himself: would a\\' were\\\\n     himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend\\\\n     or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were\\\\n     in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Excuse me.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     He is elder.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Pardon me, pardon me.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Th\\' other\\'s not come to\\'t; you shall tell me another\\\\n     tale, when th\\' other\\'s come to\\'t. Hector shall not\\\\n     have his wit this year.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     He shall not need it, if he have his own.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Nor his qualities.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     No matter.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Nor his beauty.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     \\'Twould not become him; his own\\'s better.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     You have no judgment, niece: Helen\\\\n     herself swore th\\' other day, that Troilus, for\\\\n     a brown favour--for so \\'tis, I must confess,--\\\\n     not brown neither,--\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     No, but brown.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     \\'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     To say the truth, true and not true.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     She praised his complexion above Paris.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Why, Paris hath colour enough.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     So he has.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised\\\\n     him above, his complexion is higher than his; he\\\\n     having colour enough, and the other higher, is too\\\\n     flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as\\\\n     lief Helen\\'s golden tongue had commended Troilus for\\\\n     a copper nose.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Then she\\'s a merry Greek indeed.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th\\' other\\\\n     day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he\\\\n     has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Indeed, a tapster\\'s arithmetic may soon bring his\\\\n     particulars therein to a total.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within\\\\n     three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came\\\\n     and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Why, you know \\'tis dimpled: I think his smiling\\\\n     becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     O, he smiles valiantly.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Does he not?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     O yes, an \\'twere a cloud in autumn.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen\\\\n     loves Troilus,--\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Troilus will stand to the proof, if you\\'ll\\\\n     prove it so.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem\\\\n     an addle egg.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle\\\\n     head, you would eat chickens i\\' the shell.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled\\\\n     his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I\\\\n     must needs confess,--\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Without the rack.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed\\\\n     that her eyes ran o\\'er.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     With mill-stones.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     And Cassandra laughed.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     But there was more temperate fire under the pot of\\\\n     her eyes: did her eyes run o\\'er too?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     And Hector laughed.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     At what was all this laughing?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus\\' chin.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     An\\'t had been a green hair, I should have laughed\\\\n     too.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     What was his answer?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Quoth she, \\'Here\\'s but two and fifty hairs on your\\\\n     chin, and one of them is white.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     This is her question.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     That\\'s true; make no question of that. \\'Two and\\\\n     fifty hairs\\' quoth he, \\'and one white: that white\\\\n     hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.\\'\\\\n     \\'Jupiter!\\' quoth she, \\'which of these hairs is Paris,\\\\n     my husband? \\'The forked one,\\' quoth he, \\'pluck\\'t\\\\n     out, and give it him.\\' But there was such laughing!\\\\n     and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the\\\\n     rest so laughed, that it passed.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     So let it now; for it has been while going by.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on\\'t.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     So I do.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     I\\'ll be sworn \\'tis true; he will weep you, an \\'twere\\\\n     a man born in April.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     And I\\'ll spring up in his tears, an \\'twere a nettle\\\\n     against May.\\\\n     A retreat sounded\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we\\\\n     stand up here, and see them as they pass toward\\\\n     Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     At your pleasure.\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Here, here, here\\'s an excellent place; here we may\\\\n     see most bravely: I\\'ll tell you them all by their\\\\n     names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Speak not so loud.\\\\n     AENEAS passes\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     That\\'s AEneas: is not that a brave man? he\\'s one of\\\\n     the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark\\\\n     Troilus; you shall see anon.\\\\n     ANTENOR passes\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Who\\'s that?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     That\\'s Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;\\\\n     and he\\'s a man good enough, he\\'s one o\\' the soundest\\\\n     judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.\\\\n     When comes Troilus? I\\'ll show you Troilus anon: if\\\\n     he see me, you shall see him nod at me.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Will he give you the nod?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     You shall see.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     If he do, the rich shall have more.\\\\n     HECTOR passes\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     That\\'s Hector, that, that, look you, that; there\\'s a\\\\n     fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There\\'s a brave man,\\\\n     niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there\\'s\\\\n     a countenance! is\\'t not a brave man?\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     O, a brave man!\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Is a\\' not? it does a man\\'s heart good. Look you\\\\n     what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do\\\\n     you see? look you there: there\\'s no jesting;\\\\n     there\\'s laying on, take\\'t off who will, as they say:\\\\n     there be hacks!\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Be those with swords?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come\\\\n     to him, it\\'s all one: by God\\'s lid, it does one\\'s\\\\n     heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.\\\\n     PARIS passes\\\\n     Look ye yonder, niece; is\\'t not a gallant man too,\\\\n     is\\'t not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came\\\\n     hurt home to-day? he\\'s not hurt: why, this will do\\\\n     Helen\\'s heart good now, ha! Would I could see\\\\n     Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.\\\\n     HELENUS passes\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Who\\'s that?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     That\\'s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That\\'s\\\\n     Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That\\'s Helenus.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Can Helenus fight, uncle?\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Helenus? no. Yes, he\\'ll fight indifferent well. I\\\\n     marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the\\\\n     people cry \\'Troilus\\'? Helenus is a priest.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     What sneaking fellow comes yonder?\\\\n     TROILUS passes\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Where? yonder? that\\'s Deiphobus. \\'Tis Troilus!\\\\n     there\\'s a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the\\\\n     prince of chivalry!\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Peace, for shame, peace!\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon\\\\n     him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and\\\\n     his helm more hacked than Hector\\'s, and how he looks,\\\\n     and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne\\'er saw\\\\n     three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!\\\\n     Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,\\\\n     he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?\\\\n     Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to\\\\n     change, would give an eye to boot.\\\\nCRESSIDA\\\\n     Here come more.\\\\n     Forces pass\\\\nPANDARUS\\\\n     Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!\\\\n     porridge after meat!

Why then, you princes,\\\\n     Do you with cheeks abash\\'d behold our works,\\\\n     And call them shames? which are indeed nought else\\\\n     But the protractive trials of great Jove\\\\n     To find persistive constancy in men:\\\\n     The fineness of which metal is not found\\\\n     In fortune\\'s love; for then the bold and coward,\\\\n     The wise and fool, the artist and unread,\\\\n     The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:\\\\n     But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,\\\\n     Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,\\\\n     Puffing at all, winnows the light away;\\\\n     And what hath mass or matter, by itself\\\\n     Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.\\\\nNESTOR\\\\n     With due observance of thy godlike seat,\\\\n     Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply\\\\n     Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance\\\\n     Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,\\\\n     How many shallow bauble boats dare sail\\\\n     Upon her patient breast, making their way\\\\n     With those of nobler bulk!\\\\n     But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage\\\\n     The gentle Thetis, and anon behold\\\\n     The strong-ribb\\'d bark through liquid mountains cut,\\\\n     Bounding between the two moist elements,\\\\n     Like Perseus\\' horse: where\\'s then the saucy boat\\\\n     Whose weak untimber\\'d sides but even now\\\\n     Co-rivall\\'d greatness?

Even so\\\\n     Doth valour\\'s show and valour\\'s worth divide\\\\n     In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness\\\\n     The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze\\\\n     Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind\\\\n     Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,\\\\n     And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage\\\\n     As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,\\\\n     And with an accent tuned in selfsame key\\\\n     Retorts to chiding fortune.\\\\nULYSSES\\\\n     Agamemnon,\\\\n     Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,\\\\n     Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.\\\\n     In whom the tempers and the minds of all\\\\n     Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.\\\\n     Besides the applause and approbation To which,\\\\n     To AGAMEMNON\\\\n     most mighty for thy place and sway,\\\\n     To NESTOR\\\\n     And thou most reverend for thy stretch\\'d-out life\\\\n     I give to both your speeches, which were such\\\\n     As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece\\\\n     Should hold up high in brass, and such again\\\\n     As venerable Nestor, hatch\\'d in silver,\\\\n     Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree\\\\n     On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears\\\\n     To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,\\\\n     Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.\\\\nAGAMEMNON\\\\n     Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be\\'t of less expect\\\\n     That matter needless, of importless burden,\\\\n     Divide thy lips, than we are confident,\\\\n     When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,\\\\n     We shall hear music, wit and oracle.\\\\nULYSSES\\\\n     Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,\\\\n     And the great Hector\\'s sword had lack\\'d a master,\\\\n     But for these instances.\\\\n     The specialty of rule hath been neglected:\\\\n     And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand\\\\n     Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.\\\\n     When that the general is not like the hive\\\\n     To whom the foragers shall all repair,\\\\n     What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,\\\\n     The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.\\\\n     The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre\\\\n     Observe degree, priority and place,\\\\n     Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,\\\\n     Office and custom, in all line of order;\\\\n     And therefore is the glorious planet Sol\\\\n     In noble eminence enthroned and sphered\\\\n     Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye\\\\n     Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,\\\\n     And posts, like the commandment of a king,\\\\n     Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets\\\\n     In evil mixture to disorder wander,\\\\n     What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!\\\\n     What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!\\\\n     Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,\\\\n     Divert and crack, rend and deracinate\\\\n     The unity and married calm of states\\\\n     Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,\\\\n     Which is the ladder to all high designs,\\\\n     Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,\\\\n     Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,\\\\n     Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,\\\\n     The primogenitive and due of birth,\\\\n     Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,\\\\n     But by degree, stand in authentic place?\\\\n     Take but degree away, untune that string,\\\\n     And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets\\\\n     In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters\\\\n     Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores\\\\n     And make a sop of all this solid globe:\\\\n     Strength should be lord of imbecility,\\\\n     And the rude son should strike his father dead:\\\\n     Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,\\\\n     Between whose endless jar justice resides,\\\\n     Should lose their names, and so should justice too.\\\\n     Then every thing includes itself in power,\\\\n     Power into will, will into appetite;\\\\n     And appetite, an universal wolf,\\\\n     So doubly seconded with will and power,\\\\n     Must make perforce an universal prey,\\\\n     And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\\\\n     This chaos, when degree is suffocate,\\\\n     Follows the choking.\\\\n     And this neglection of degree it is\\\\n     That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose\\\\n     It hath to climb.

To end a tale of length,\\\\n     Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.\\\\nNESTOR\\\\n     Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover\\'d\\\\n     The fever whereof all our power is sick.\\\\nAGAMEMNON\\\\n     The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,\\\\n     What is the remedy?\\\\nULYSSES\\\\n     The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns\\\\n     The sinew and the forehand of our host,\\\\n     Having his ear full of his airy fame,\\\\n     Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent\\\\n     Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus\\\\n     Upon a lazy bed the livelong day\\\\n     Breaks scurril jests;\\\\n     And with ridiculous and awkward action,\\\\n     Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,\\\\n     He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,\\\\n     Thy topless deputation he puts on,\\\\n     And, like a strutting player, whose conceit\\\\n     Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich\\\\n     To hear the wooden dialogue and sound\\\\n     \\'Twixt his stretch\\'d footing and the scaffoldage,--\\\\n     Such to-be-pitied and o\\'er-wrested seeming\\\\n     He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,\\\\n     \\'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,\\\\n     Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp\\'d\\\\n     Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff\\\\n     The large Achilles, on his press\\'d bed lolling,\\\\n     From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;\\\\n     Cries \\'Excellent! \\'tis Agamemnon just.\\\\n     Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,\\\\n     As he being drest to some oration.\\'\\\\n     That\\'s done, as near as the extremest ends\\\\n     Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:\\\\n     Yet god Achilles still cries \\'Excellent!\\\\n     \\'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,\\\\n     Arming to answer in a night alarm.\\'\\\\n     And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age\\\\n     Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,\\\\n     And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,\\\\n     Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport\\\\n     Sir Valour dies; cries \\'O, enough, Patroclus;\\\\n     Or give me ribs of steel!

Let Helen go:\\\\n     Since the first sword was drawn about this question,\\\\n     Every tithe soul, \\'mongst many thousand dismes,\\\\n     Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:\\\\n     If we have lost so many tenths of ours,\\\\n     To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,\\\\n     Had it our name, the value of one ten,\\\\n     What merit\\'s in that reason which denies\\\\n     The yielding of her up?\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Fie, fie, my brother!\\\\n     Weigh you the worth and honour of a king\\\\n     So great as our dread father in a scale\\\\n     Of common ounces? will you with counters sum\\\\n     The past proportion of his infinite?\\\\n     And buckle in a waist most fathomless\\\\n     With spans and inches so diminutive\\\\n     As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!\\\\nHELENUS\\\\n     No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,\\\\n     You are so empty of them.

Here are\\\\n     your reasons:\\\\n     You know an enemy intends you harm;\\\\n     You know a sword employ\\'d is perilous,\\\\n     And reason flies the object of all harm:\\\\n     Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds\\\\n     A Grecian and his sword, if he do set\\\\n     The very wings of reason to his heels\\\\n     And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,\\\\n     Or like a star disorb\\'d?

It was thought meet\\\\n     Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:\\\\n     Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;\\\\n     The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce\\\\n     And did him service: he touch\\'d the ports desired,\\\\n     And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,\\\\n     He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness\\\\n     Wrinkles Apollo\\'s, and makes stale the morning.\\\\n     Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:\\\\n     Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,\\\\n     Whose price hath launch\\'d above a thousand ships,\\\\n     And turn\\'d crown\\'d kings to merchants.\\\\n     If you\\'ll avouch \\'twas wisdom Paris went--\\\\n     As you must needs, for you all cried \\'Go, go,\\'--\\\\n     If you\\'ll confess he brought home noble prize--\\\\n     As you must needs, for you all clapp\\'d your hands\\\\n     And cried \\'Inestimable!\\'--why do you now\\\\n     The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,\\\\n     And do a deed that fortune never did,\\\\n     Beggar the estimation which you prized\\\\n     Richer than sea and land?

Yet, I protest,\\\\n     Were I alone to pass the difficulties\\\\n     And had as ample power as I have will,\\\\n     Paris should ne\\'er retract what he hath done,\\\\n     Nor faint in the pursuit.\\\\nPRIAM\\\\n     Paris, you speak\\\\n     Like one besotted on your sweet delights:\\\\n     You have the honey still, but these the gall;\\\\n     So to be valiant is no praise at all.\\\\nPARIS\\\\n     Sir, I propose not merely to myself\\\\n     The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;\\\\n     But I would have the soil of her fair rape\\\\n     Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.\\\\n     What treason were it to the ransack\\'d queen,\\\\n     Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,\\\\n     Now to deliver her possession up\\\\n     On terms of base compulsion! Can it be\\\\n     That so degenerate a strain as this\\\\n     Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?\\\\n     There\\'s not the meanest spirit on our party\\\\n     Without a heart to dare or sword to draw\\\\n     When Helen is defended, nor none so noble\\\\n     Whose life were ill bestow\\'d or death unfamed\\\\n     Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,\\\\n     Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,\\\\n     The world\\'s large spaces cannot parallel.\\\\nHECTOR\\\\n     Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,\\\\n     And on the cause and question now in hand\\\\n     Have glozed, but superficially: not much\\\\n     Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought\\\\n     Unfit to hear moral philosophy:\\\\n     The reasons you allege do more conduce\\\\n     To the hot passion of distemper\\'d blood\\\\n     Than to make up a free determination\\\\n     \\'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge\\\\n     Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice\\\\n     Of any true decision. Nature craves\\\\n     All dues be render\\'d to their owners: now,\\\\n     What nearer debt in all humanity\\\\n     Than wife is to the husband? If this law\\\\n     Of nature be corrupted through affection,\\\\n     And that great minds, of partial indulgence\\\\n     To their benumbed wills, resist the same,\\\\n     There is a law in each well-order\\'d nation\\\\n     To curb those raging appetites that are\\\\n     Most disobedient and refractory.\\\\n     If Helen then be wife to Sparta\\'s king,\\\\n     As it is known she is, these moral laws\\\\n     Of nature and of nations speak aloud\\\\n     To have her back return\\'d: thus to persist\\\\n     In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,\\\\n     But makes it much more heavy. Hector\\'s opinion\\\\n     Is this in way of truth; yet ne\\'ertheless,\\\\n     My spritely brethren, I propend to you\\\\n     In resolution to keep Helen still,\\\\n     For \\'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance\\\\n     Upon our joint and several dignities.\\\\nTROILUS\\\\n     Why, there you touch\\'d the life of our design:\\\\n     Were it not glory that we more affected\\\\n     Than the performance of our heaving spleens,\\\\n     I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood\\\\n     Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,\\\\n     She is a theme of honour and renown,\\\\n     A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,\\\\n     Whose present courage may beat down our foes,\\\\n     And fame in time to come canonize us;\\\\n     For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose\\\\n     So rich advantage of a promised glory\\\\n     As smiles upon the forehead of this action\\\\n     For the wide world\\'s revenue.\\\\nHECTOR\\\\n     I am yours,\\\\n     You valiant offspring of great Priamus.\\\\n     I have a roisting challenge sent amongst\\\\n     The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks\\\\n     Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:\\\\n     I was advertised their great general slept,\\\\n     Whilst emulation in the army crept:\\\\n     This, I presume, will wake him.\\\\n     Exeunt\\\\n**** SCENE III.

Then there\\'s Achilles, a\\\\n     rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two\\\\n     undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of\\\\n     themselves.

This is not strange at all.\\\\nULYSSES\\\\n     I do not strain at the position,--\\\\n     It is familiar,--but at the author\\'s drift;\\\\n     Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves\\\\n     That no man is the lord of any thing,\\\\n     Though in and of him there be much consisting,\\\\n     Till he communicate his parts to others:\\\\n     Nor doth he of himself know them for aught\\\\n     Till he behold them form\\'d in the applause\\\\n     Where they\\'re extended; who, like an arch,\\\\n     reverberates\\\\n     The voice again, or, like a gate of steel\\\\n     Fronting the sun, receives and renders back\\\\n     His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;\\\\n     And apprehended here immediately\\\\n     The unknown Ajax.\\\\n     Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,\\\\n     That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are\\\\n     Most abject in regard and dear in use!\\\\n     What things again most dear in the esteem\\\\n     And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--\\\\n     An act that very chance doth throw upon him--\\\\n     Ajax renown\\'d. O heavens, what some men do,\\\\n     While some men leave to do!\\\\n     How some men creep in skittish fortune\\'s hall,\\\\n     Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!\\\\n     How one man eats into another\\'s pride,\\\\n     While pride is fasting in his wantonness!\\\\n     To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already\\\\n     They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,\\\\n     As if his foot were on brave Hector\\'s breast\\\\n     And great Troy shrieking.\\\\nACHILLES\\\\n     I do believe it; for they pass\\'d by me\\\\n     As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me\\\\n     Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?\\\\nULYSSES\\\\n     Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\\\\n     Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,\\\\n     A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:\\\\n     Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour\\'d\\\\n     As fast as they are made, forgot as soon\\\\n     As done: perseverance, dear my lord,\\\\n     Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang\\\\n     Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\\\\n     In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;\\\\n     For honour travels in a strait so narrow,\\\\n     Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;\\\\n     For emulation hath a thousand sons\\\\n     That one by one pursue: if you give way,\\\\n     Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,\\\\n     Like to an enter\\'d tide, they all rush by\\\\n     And leave you hindmost;\\\\n     Or like a gallant horse fall\\'n in first rank,\\\\n     Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,\\\\n     O\\'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,\\\\n     Though less than yours in past, must o\\'ertop yours;\\\\n     For time is like a fashionable host\\\\n     That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,\\\\n     And with his arms outstretch\\'d, as he would fly,\\\\n     Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,\\\\n     And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not\\\\n     virtue seek\\\\n     Remuneration for the thing it was;\\\\n     For beauty, wit,\\\\n     High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,\\\\n     Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all\\\\n     To envious and calumniating time.\\\\n     One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\\\\n     That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,\\\\n     Though they are made and moulded of things past,\\\\n     And give to dust that is a little gilt\\\\n     More laud than gilt o\\'er-dusted.\\\\n     The present eye praises the present object.\\\\n     Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,\\\\n     That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;\\\\n     Since things in motion sooner catch the eye\\\\n     Than what not stirs.
