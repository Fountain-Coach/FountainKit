You were\\\\n     wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you\\\\n     walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you\\\\n     fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you\\\\n     looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you\\\\n     are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look\\\\n     on you, I can hardly think you my master.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Are all these things perceived in me?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     They are all perceived without ye.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Without me? they cannot.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Without you? nay, that\\'s certain, for, without you\\\\n     were so simple, none else would: but you are so\\\\n     without these follies, that these follies are within\\\\n     you and shine through you like the water in an\\\\n     urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a\\\\n     physician to comment on your malady.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Why, sir, I know her not.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet\\\\n     knowest her not?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Is she not hard-favoured, sir?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Sir, I know that well enough.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     What dost thou know?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     That\\'s because the one is painted and the other out\\\\n     of all count.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     How painted? and how out of count?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no\\\\n     man counts of her beauty.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     You never saw her since she was deformed.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     How long hath she been deformed?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Ever since you loved her.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I\\\\n     see her beautiful.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     If you love her, you cannot see her.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Why?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;\\\\n     or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to\\\\n     have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going\\\\n     ungartered!\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     What should I see then?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Your own present folly and her passing deformity:\\\\n     for he, being in love, could not see to garter his\\\\n     hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last\\\\n     morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,\\\\n     you swinged me for my love, which makes me the\\\\n     bolder to chide you for yours.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     In conclusion, I stand affected to her.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     I would you were set, so your affection would cease.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to\\\\n     one she loves.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     And have you?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     I have.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Are they not lamely writ?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!\\\\n     here she comes.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     [Aside] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!\\\\n     Now will he interpret to her.\\\\n     Enter SILVIA\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     [Aside] O, give ye good even! here\\'s a million of manners.\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     [Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     As you enjoin\\'d me, I have writ your letter\\\\n     Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;\\\\n     Which I was much unwilling to proceed in\\\\n     But for my duty to your ladyship.\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     I thank you gentle servant: \\'tis very clerkly done.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;\\\\n     For being ignorant to whom it goes\\\\n     I writ at random, very doubtfully.\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     Perchance you think too much of so much pains?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     No, madam; so it stead you, I will write\\\\n     Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;\\\\n     And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;\\\\n     And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,\\\\n     Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     [Aside] And yet you will; and yet another \\'yet.\\'\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     What means your ladyship? do you not like it?\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;\\\\n     But since unwillingly, take them again.\\\\n     Nay, take them.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Madam, they are for you.\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;\\\\n     But I will none of them; they are for you;\\\\n     I would have had them writ more movingly.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Please you, I\\'ll write your ladyship another.\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     And when it\\'s writ, for my sake read it over,\\\\n     And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     If it please me, madam, what then?\\\\nSILVIA\\\\n     Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:\\\\n     And so, good morrow, servant.\\\\n     Exit\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,\\\\n     As a nose on a man\\'s face, or a weathercock on a steeple!\\\\n     My master sues to her, and she hath\\\\n     taught her suitor,\\\\n     He being her pupil, to become her tutor.\\\\n     O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,\\\\n     That my master, being scribe, to himself should write\\\\n     the letter?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Nay, I was rhyming: \\'tis you that have the reason.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     To do what?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     To whom?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     What figure?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     By a letter, I should say.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     Why, she hath not writ to me?\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     What need she, when she hath made you write to\\\\n     yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     No, believe me.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive\\\\n     her earnest?\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     She gave me none, except an angry word.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Why, she hath given you a letter.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     That\\'s the letter I writ to her friend.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     I would it were no worse.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     I\\'ll warrant you, \\'tis as well:\\\\n     For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,\\\\n     Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;\\\\n     Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,\\\\n     Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.\\\\n     All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.\\\\n     Why muse you, sir? \\'tis dinner-time.\\\\nVALENTINE\\\\n     I have dined.\\\\nSPEED\\\\n     Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can\\\\n     feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my\\\\n     victuals, and would fain have meat.

I\\\\n     have received my proportion, like the prodigious\\\\n     son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial\\'s\\\\n     court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured\\\\n     dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father\\\\n     wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat\\\\n     wringing her hands, and all our house in a great\\\\n     perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed\\\\n     one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and\\\\n     has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have\\\\n     wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,\\\\n     having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my\\\\n     parting. Nay, I\\'ll show you the manner of it. This\\\\n     shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:\\\\n     no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that\\\\n     cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it\\\\n     hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in\\\\n     it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance\\\\n     on\\'t! there \\'tis: now, sit, this staff is my\\\\n     sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and\\\\n     as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I\\\\n     am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the\\\\n     dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,\\\\n     so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:\\\\n     now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:\\\\n     now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now\\\\n     come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now\\\\n     like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there\\\\n     \\'tis; here\\'s my mother\\'s breath up and down. Now\\\\n     come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now\\\\n     the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a\\\\n     word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.\\\\n     Enter PANTHINO\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped\\\\n     and thou art to post after with oars. What\\'s the\\\\n     matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You\\'ll\\\\n     lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the\\\\n     unkindest tied that ever any man tied.\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     What\\'s the unkindest tide?\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     Why, he that\\'s tied here, Crab, my dog.\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     Tut, man, I mean thou\\'lt lose the flood, and, in\\\\n     losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing\\\\n     thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy\\\\n     master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy\\\\n     service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     Where should I lose my tongue?\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     In thy tale.\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     In thy tail!\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and\\\\n     the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river\\\\n     were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the\\\\n     wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     Sir, call me what thou darest.\\\\nPANTHINO\\\\n     Wilt thou go?\\\\nLAUNCE\\\\n     Well, I will go.\\\\n     Exeunt\\\\n**** SCENE IV.

An old\\\\n     lord of the council rated me the other day in the\\\\n     street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet\\\\n     he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and\\\\n     yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the\\\\n     streets, and no man regards it.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able\\\\n     to corrupt a saint.

Tut! there are other Trojans that thou\\\\n     dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are\\\\n     content to do the profession some grace; that would,\\\\n     if matters should be looked into, for their own\\\\n     credit sake, make all whole.

I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell\\\\n     thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou\\\\n     knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my\\\\n     point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     What, four? thou saidst but two even now.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Four, Hal; I told thee four.\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     Ay, ay, he said four.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at\\\\n     me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven\\\\n     points in my target, thus.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Seven? why, there were but four even now.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     In buckram?\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     Ay, four, in buckram suits.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Dost thou hear me, Hal?\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine\\\\n     in buckram that I told thee of--\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     So, two more already.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Their points being broken,--\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     Down fell their hose.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,\\\\n     came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of\\\\n     the eleven I paid.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten\\\\n     knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive\\\\n     at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst\\\\n     not see thy hand.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     These lies are like their father that begets them;\\\\n     gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou\\\\n     clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou\\\\n     whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth\\\\n     the truth?\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal\\\\n     green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy\\\\n     hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     What, upon compulsion? \\'Zounds, an I were at the\\\\n     strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would\\\\n     not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on\\\\n     compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as\\\\n     blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon\\\\n     compulsion, I.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     I\\'ll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine\\\\n     coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,\\\\n     this huge hill of flesh,--\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     \\'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried\\\\n     neat\\'s tongue, you bull\\'s pizzle, you stock-fish! O\\\\n     for breath to utter what is like thee! you\\\\n     tailor\\'s-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile\\\\n     standing-tuck,--\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and\\\\n     when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,\\\\n     hear me speak but this.\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     Mark, Jack.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and\\\\n     were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain\\\\n     tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you\\\\n     four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your\\\\n     prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in\\\\n     the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts\\\\n     away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared\\\\n     for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard\\\\n     bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword\\\\n     as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!\\\\n     What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst\\\\n     thou now find out to hide thee from this open and\\\\n     apparent shame?\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     Come, let\\'s hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.\\\\n     Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the\\\\n     heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?\\\\n     why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but\\\\n     beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true\\\\n     prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a\\\\n     coward on instinct. I shall think the better of\\\\n     myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant\\\\n     lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,\\\\n     lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap\\\\n     to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.\\\\n     Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles\\\\n     of good fellowship come to you!

I\\\\n     did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed\\\\n     to hear his monstrous devices.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years\\\\n     ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since\\\\n     thou hast blushed extempore.

There\\'s villanous news abroad: here was\\\\n     Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the\\\\n     court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the\\\\n     north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the\\\\n     bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the\\\\n     devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh\\\\n     hook--what a plague call you him?\\\\nPOINS\\\\n     O, Glendower.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,\\\\n     and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of\\\\n     Scots, Douglas, that runs o\\' horseback up a hill\\\\n     perpendicular,--\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     He that rides at high speed and with his pistol\\\\n     kills a sparrow flying.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     You have hit it.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     So did he never the sparrow.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so\\\\n     for running!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     O\\' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Yes, Jack, upon instinct.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,\\\\n     and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:\\\\n     Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father\\'s\\\\n     beard is turned white with the news: you may buy\\\\n     land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and\\\\n     this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads\\\\n     as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we\\\\n     shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,\\\\n     art not thou horrible afeard? thou being\\\\n     heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three\\\\n     such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that\\\\n     spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou\\\\n     not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at\\\\n     it?\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Not a whit, i\\' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou\\\\n     comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the\\\\n     particulars of my life.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,\\\\n     this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden\\\\n     sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich\\\\n     crown for a pitiful bald crown!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,\\\\n     now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to\\\\n     make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have\\\\n     wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it\\\\n     in King Cambyses\\' vein.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Well, here is my leg.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i\\' faith!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     O, the father, how he holds his countenance!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     For God\\'s sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;\\\\n     For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry\\\\n     players as ever I see!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.\\\\n     Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy\\\\n     time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though\\\\n     the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster\\\\n     it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the\\\\n     sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have\\\\n     partly thy mother\\'s word, partly my own opinion,\\\\n     but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a\\\\n     foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant\\\\n     me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;\\\\n     why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall\\\\n     the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat\\\\n     blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall\\\\n     the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a\\\\n     question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,\\\\n     which thou hast often heard of and it is known to\\\\n     many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,\\\\n     as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth\\\\n     the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not\\\\n     speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in\\\\n     pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in\\\\n     woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I\\\\n     have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     What manner of man, an it like your majesty?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     A goodly portly man, i\\' faith, and a corpulent; of a\\\\n     cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble\\\\n     carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,\\\\n     by\\'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I\\\\n     remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man\\\\n     should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,\\\\n     I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be\\\\n     known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,\\\\n     peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that\\\\n     Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell\\\\n     me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast\\\\n     thou been this month?\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,\\\\n     and I\\'ll play my father.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so\\\\n     majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by\\\\n     the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter\\'s hare.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Well, here I am set.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     And here I stand: judge, my masters.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Now, Harry, whence come you?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     My noble lord, from Eastcheap.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     \\'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I\\'ll tickle\\\\n     ye for a young prince, i\\' faith.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne\\'er look\\\\n     on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:\\\\n     there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an\\\\n     old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion.

Why my\\\\n     skin hangs about me like an like an old lady\\'s loose\\\\n     gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,\\\\n     I\\'ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some\\\\n     liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I\\\\n     shall have no strength to repent. An I have not\\\\n     forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I\\\\n     am a peppercorn, a brewer\\'s horse: the inside of a\\\\n     church! Company, villanous company, hath been the\\\\n     spoil of me.\\\\nBARDOLPH\\\\n     Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make\\\\n     me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman\\\\n     need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not\\\\n     above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once\\\\n     in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I\\\\n     borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in\\\\n     good compass: and now I live out of all order, out\\\\n     of all compass.\\\\nBARDOLPH\\\\n     Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs\\\\n     be out of all compass, out of all reasonable\\\\n     compass, Sir John.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Do thou amend thy face, and I\\'ll amend my life:\\\\n     thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in\\\\n     the poop, but \\'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the\\\\n     Knight of the Burning Lamp.\\\\nBARDOLPH\\\\n     Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     No, I\\'ll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many\\\\n     a man doth of a Death\\'s-head or a memento mori: I\\\\n     never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and\\\\n     Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his\\\\n     robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way\\\\n     given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath\\\\n     should be \\'By this fire, that\\'s God\\'s angel:\\' but\\\\n     thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but\\\\n     for the light in thy face, the son of utter\\\\n     darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the\\\\n     night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou\\\\n     hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,\\\\n     there\\'s no purchase in money. O, thou art a\\\\n     perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!\\\\n     Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and\\\\n     torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt\\\\n     tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast\\\\n     drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap\\\\n     at the dearest chandler\\'s in Europe.

I have searched,\\\\n     I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy\\\\n     by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair\\\\n     was never lost in my house before.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many\\\\n     a hair; and I\\'ll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go\\\\n     to, you are a woman, go.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     Who, I? no; I defy thee: God\\'s light, I was never\\\\n     called so in mine own house before.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Go to, I know you well enough.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know\\\\n     you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now\\\\n     you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought\\\\n     you a dozen of shirts to your back.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to\\\\n     bakers\\' wives, and they have made bolters of them.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight\\\\n     shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir\\\\n     John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent\\\\n     you, four and twenty pound.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     He had his part of it; let him pay.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?\\\\n     let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:\\\\n     Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker\\\\n     of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I\\\\n     shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a\\\\n     seal-ring of my grandfather\\'s worth forty mark.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not\\\\n     how oft, that ring was copper!\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: \\'sblood, an\\\\n     he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he\\\\n     would say so.\\\\n     Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them\\\\n     playing on his truncheon like a life\\\\n     How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i\\' faith?\\\\n     must we all march?\\\\nBARDOLPH\\\\n     Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     My lord, I pray you, hear me.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly?

Go, you thing,\\\\n     go\\\\nHostess\\\\n     Say, what thing? what thing?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou\\\\n     shouldst know it; I am an honest man\\'s wife: and,\\\\n     setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to\\\\n     call me so.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say\\\\n     otherwise.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     What beast! why, an otter.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Why, she\\'s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not\\\\n     where to have her.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any\\\\n     man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you\\\\n     ought him a thousand pound.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth\\\\n     a million: thou owest me thy love.\\\\nHostess\\\\n     Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would\\\\n     cudgel you.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Did I, Bardolph?\\\\nBARDOLPH\\\\n     Indeed, Sir John, you said so.\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Yea, if he said my ring was copper.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     I say \\'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:\\\\n     but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the\\\\n     roaring of a lion\\'s whelp.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     And why not as the lion?\\\\nFALSTAFF\\\\n     The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou\\\\n     think I\\'ll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an\\\\n     I do, I pray God my girdle break.\\\\nPRINCE HENRY\\\\n     O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy\\\\n     knees!

I pressed me none but such\\\\n     toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no\\\\n     bigger than pins\\' heads, and they have bought out\\\\n     their services; and now my whole charge consists of\\\\n     ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of\\\\n     companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the\\\\n     painted cloth, where the glutton\\'s dogs licked his\\\\n     sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but\\\\n     discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to\\\\n     younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers\\\\n     trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a\\\\n     long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than\\\\n     an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up\\\\n     the rooms of them that have bought out their\\\\n     services, that you would think that I had a hundred\\\\n     and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from\\\\n     swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad\\\\n     fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded\\\\n     all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye\\\\n     hath seen such scarecrows. I\\'ll not march through\\\\n     Coventry with them, that\\'s flat: nay, and the\\\\n     villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had\\\\n     gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of\\\\n     prison. There\\'s but a shirt and a half in all my\\\\n     company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked\\\\n     together and thrown over the shoulders like an\\\\n     herald\\'s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say\\\\n     the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban\\'s, or\\\\n     the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.

KING LEWIS XI\\\\n     sits, and riseth up again\\\\nKING LEWIS XI\\\\n     Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,\\\\n     Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state\\\\n     And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.\\\\nQUEEN MARGARET\\\\n     No, mighty King of France: now Margaret\\\\n     Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve\\\\n     Where kings command.
