# Plans/Legacy — Historical and Superseded Plans

This folder contains older plans and whitepapers that are useful for historical context but are no longer the primary source of truth for current work. They may describe now-completed migrations, deprecated technologies, or earlier iterations of the architecture.

Active plans live one level up under `Plans/` and are referenced from the root `AGENTS.md` “Plans Index”. When in doubt:

- Treat documents under `Plans/Legacy/` as background reading.
- Rely on the corresponding AGENTS files and active plans for up-to-date decisions.
