# **Reasoning on Observability: Policy-Bound LLM Intelligence for FountainAI**

## 1. Overview
This whitepaper defines how LLM reasoning interacts with observability data under strict governance.  
It enforces the rule: **The LLM may interpret, hypothesize, and recommend—but not act autonomously.**

---

## 2. Cognitive Framework

| Step | Function |
|------|-----------|
| **Summarize** | Restate key deviations vs. baselines. |
| **Hypothesize** | Generate possible root causes. |
| **Test** | Select vetted PromQL queries to validate. |
| **Synthesize** | Evaluate evidence, assign confidence. |
| **Recommend** | Propose reversible, policy-bound actions. |
| **Verify** | Define success and rollback criteria. |

---

## 3. Operational Modes

| Mode | Description | Control |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Advisor** | LLM only reports insights. | Always allowed. |
| **Autopilot-Lite** | Safe reversible actions (e.g., debug logging). | Needs policy approval. |

---

## 4. Governance Rules

1. **Read-only default:** No direct system mutation.  
2. **Two-key rule:** Human + policy approval for any action.  
3. **Multi-signal validation:** Require >1 corroborating metric.  
4. **Rollback first:** Every action must define rollback.  
5. **Confidence disclosure:** Always provide probability estimate.  
6. **No alert suppression or threshold editing.**

## 5. Example

**Situation:** Error rate ↑ after Redis TTL change.  
**LLM:**
- Hypothesis: Short TTL → cache misses → backend overload.  
- Tests: Drop in cache hit ratio, increase in Redis latency.  
- Confidence: 0.72.  
- Recommendation: Revert TTL; canary 5%; abort if latency > 300ms.  
- Verification: Availability > 99.8% within 20 min.

## 6. Oversight Structure

- **Policy Engine:** Evaluates safety, scope, and reversibility.  
- **Human Operator:** Reviews evidence and approves.  
- **Audit Log:** Immutable records of reasoning and outcome.  

---

## 7. Ethical & Operational Implications

| Benefit | Safeguard |
|----------|-----------|
| Rapid causal insight | Strict read-only telemetry. |
| Safer automation | Policy + human gating. |
| Reduced alert fatigue | Narrative summaries instead of floods. |
| Higher transparency | Full reasoning logs. |

---

## 8. Future Directions

- Multi-agent reasoning on telemetry graphs.  
- Adaptive policy calibration from historical success.  
- Integration with tracing and event streams.  

---

## 9. Conclusion

The **Prometheus → LLM exchange** represents a new generation of **explainable operational intelligence**—  
where reasoning augments human reliability engineering without compromising safety or control.
