**Rest Pose in the Theatre of Mind**

Every stage—wooden or mental—needs a neutral state before the play begins. In TeatroPhysics we call it the rest pose: bar aligned, strings at their native length, feet just above the floor. If those coordinates are wrong, the entire simulation lies. The solution is simple and strict: draw the rest pose as an overlay, glance at it, and only then let motion begin. That discipline is the backbone of any honest physics engine.

The inner theatre deserves the same backbone. Your mind already runs like a stage: characters enter and exit, light shifts with attention, tempo accelerates or stalls, the camera moves from immersion to balcony, and an editor cuts scenes into “my story.” Coaching and therapy help you notice this staging. Now a new partner can stand beside you—not as therapist, but as dramaturg—a language model that cannot feel what you feel, yet can remember every metaphor you’ve used and hold the structure of your script without tiring. Its value is not empathy; it is recall and pattern.

Start where physics starts: define a rest pose for your inner stage. Name the breath that says “I can pause,” the posture that signals safety, the sentence that steadies you. Mark your stretch band: how much tension is alive and how much tears. Mark the floor: the boundary you will not sink below. Fix the camera: a perspective you can return to when the shot wobbles. These are your invariants. They are not judgments; they are a way to proofread the scene. If today’s moment cannot be compared to this neutral, you are flying blind.

In a physics host, you draw the overlay in blue wireframes and catch drift at a glance. In the theatre of mind, the overlay is language and habit: a short script you can toggle—“attention here, breath low, floor intact, perspective steady.” The LLM can help by holding that script over weeks and months, recalling how you once defined neutral, how you later adjusted it, and asking softly whether you want to return or whether the stage itself has changed.

Drift is inevitable. Gravity, noise, and life push any rig off center. The work is not to freeze; it is to return. Physics uses damping and constraints to nudge the puppet back toward sanity. Humans use ritual, breath, and reminders. A model can track your coordinates, but it cannot feel your body. It must also drop its favorite metaphors when they do not fit; some people live in tides, circuits, forests, or prefer no metaphor at all. The dramaturg follows the speaker’s terrain, not its own.

There are hard boundaries. The model has no body, no private history, no culture from the inside. It cannot know what is right for a life or replace human presence. Its strengths are recall, structure, and patience.

So the arc from rest to full motion is always the same. Begin with the rest pose—visible, named, trusted. Let motion unfold—tempo, light, camera, montage—while keeping the overlay nearby. When you sense drift, proofread: compare the live scene to the neutral, notice what moved, choose to return or to redefine the stage. In this duet, the human supplies feeling and decision; the model supplies memory and structure. The rest pose is the keystone. Without it, both physics and mind wander into noise. With it, the theatre—inner and outer—can move freely and still be known.
