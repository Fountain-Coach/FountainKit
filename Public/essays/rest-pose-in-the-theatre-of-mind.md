# Rest Pose in the Theatre of Mind

Every stage—wooden or mental—needs a neutral state before the play begins. In TeatroPhysics it’s the rest pose: bar aligned, strings at their native length, feet just above the floor. If those coordinates are wrong, everything that follows is a lie. That’s why the host draws a rest-pose overlay: glance, trust, then move.

The inner theatre needs the same backbone. Your mind already stages characters, shifts light with attention, changes tempo, moves the camera, edits scenes into “my story.” Coaching and therapy help you see this. A language model can stand beside you as dramaturg—holding structure and memory, not feelings. It cannot sense your body, but it can remember every metaphor you’ve used and keep track of your artistic voice: the way you speak, the tone you return to, the themes you choose. Its value is recall and pattern, not empathy.

Start where physics starts: define a rest pose for your inner stage. Name the breath that says “I can pause,” the posture that signals safety, the sentence that steadies you. Mark your stretch band—what tension enlivens versus tears. Mark your floor—the boundary you won’t sink below. Fix the camera—a perspective you can return to. These are invariants for proofreading the scene; without them, you are flying blind.

In code, the overlay is blue wireframes. In mind, it’s a short script you can toggle: “attention here, breath low, floor intact, voice steady.” The model can hold that script over time, recall how you defined neutral, how you adjusted it, and ask gently whether you want to return or whether the stage itself has changed.

Drift is inevitable. Gravity, noise, life push any rig off center. The work is to return, not to freeze. Physics uses damping and constraints; humans use ritual, breath, reminders. The dramaturg follows your terrain—tides, circuits, forests, or plain speech—rather than forcing its own.

There are hard boundaries. The model has no body, no private history, no inner culture. It cannot decide what is right for a life or replace human presence. Its strengths are recall, structure, and patience.

So the arc from rest to full motion stays the same. Begin with the rest pose—visible, named, trusted. Let motion unfold—tempo, light, camera, montage—while keeping the overlay nearby. When you sense drift, proofread: compare the live scene to the neutral, notice what moved, choose to return or to redefine the stage. You supply feeling, choice, and artistic voice. The model supplies memory and structure. The rest pose is the keystone; with it, the theatre can move freely and still be known.
