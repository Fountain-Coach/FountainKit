# AGENT — MemChat (DEPRECATED — learnings only)

Status: DEPRECATED. MemChat scripts and app launchers are kept runnable for
learnings and demos, but are not part of the active product track.

Scope: `Scripts/apps/launch-memchat-app.sh`, `Scripts/apps/memchat-oneclick.sh`,
and related helpers under `Scripts/`.

Guidance
- Do not expand or add new features. Keep launch scripts running for demos.
- Prefer Composer Studio for new UX/product work.
- If build failures arise due to upstream dependencies, fix minimally or skip.

How to run (still supported)
- One‑click: `bash Scripts/apps/memchat-oneclick.sh`
- App launcher: `bash Scripts/apps/launch-memchat-app.sh [debug|release] [--fresh]`
